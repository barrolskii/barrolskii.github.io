If you want code completion for C/C++ when using Doom Emacs you are going to need a language server. The
default for this is irony and if you run the setup function in Doom Emacs it'll compile the server and
set it up for you. In Windows you might not be able to compile the server from inside Emacs if you don't
have the required dependencies installed. This tutorial will cover what irony needs to be able to compile
on Windows through Emacs.

** The Fix

You'll need to install 2 things:
- [[https://releases.llvm.org/download.html][Clang]]
- [[https://cmake.org/download/][CMake]]

All you'll need to do is download the latest installer for both clang and cmake and run through the
installer. MAKE SURE THAT YOU ADD THEM TO YOUR PATH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE! The installers will ask
you if you want to add them to the path of all users or just the current one. It doesn't matter
which one you choose just as long as they get added to PATH. If you don't do this then the
underlying terminal emulator that emacs uses won't be able to run those programs. One they have
been installed you can run irony-install-server and have code completion working for C/C++ on
Windows!
