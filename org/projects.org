Single header libs is a repository containing a variety of projects that follow the STB single header file library style. I made this project so I could tinker with a variety of different topics while also ensuring I would be creating a library at the same time so I could use what I made in future endeavours. This all started when I wanted a dynamic array in C similar to the Vector class in C++ (I don't usually use C++ just because I prefer plain ol' C). As of writing there are only 2 libraries that have been pushed to the public repository but many more are planned to join them in the future.

This is a small project I made to help me organise and track my digital library of books (I have well over 2GB worth of books and which keeps going up with each Humble Book Bundle released). This program utilises Ncurses for the TUI (no GUI as I wanted to be able to use this via the command line) and GNU Readline for autocompletion. I could've used a database instead of writing this program but I really wanted an excuse to learn Ncurses and GNU Readline.
