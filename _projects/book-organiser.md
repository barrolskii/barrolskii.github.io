This is a small project I made to help me organise and track my digital library of
books (I have well over 2GB worth of books and which keeps going up with each Humble
Book Bundle released). This program utilises Ncurses for the TUI (no GUI as I wanted
to be able to use this via the command line) and GNU Readline for autocompletion.
I couldâ€™ve used a database instead of writing this program but I really wanted an
excuse to learn Ncurses and GNU Readline.
