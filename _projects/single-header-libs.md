Single header libs is a repository containing a variety of projects that follow the
STB single header file library style. I made this project so I could tinker with a
variety of different topics while also ensuring I would be creating a library at the
same time so I could use what I made in future endeavours. This all started when I
wanted a dynamic array in C similar to the Vector class in C++ (I don’t usually use
C++ just because I prefer plain ol’ C). As of writing there are only 2 libraries that
have been pushed to the public repository but many more are planned to join them in the future.

## Dynamic Array

A C++ style vector struct. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Hashtable

Hashtable implementation using a dynamically resizing, open addressed hashtable with the FNV-1
hashing algorithm.
