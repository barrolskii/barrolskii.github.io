		<h1>June Update</h1>
		<h2>Rambling, updates, and other things</h2>

		<time datetime="05-07-2020">JUL. 05, 2020</time>
		<p>Things have been getting quite busy for me as of lately. I'm getting
		ready for moving back to University, I've got an assessment I need to
		hand in soon, I've got even more things to do in work and it seems my
		list of projects I want to do is getting bigger and bigger. So as I
		completely neglected making any blog posts last month I thought I'd make
		one now going over the month of June and what's been going on with me.</p>

		<h3>University</h3>
		<p>I move back to University very very soon. Exactly 2 months yesterday.
		I'm going to sound like an old man here but I cannot believe how fast
		the time has gone. I've almost been on placement for an entire year
		and when I finish I'll be going into my final year of University. That
		actually blows my mind. That's 3 years just gone like that. I've loved
		every minute of it. The nerves have started kicking in now about moving
		back and that's not just because of the pandemic that's still around.
		I'm just nervous about going back because I know how quick the time will
		go and honestly I want a few more years at uni. I remember teachers back
		in high school saying these will be the best years of your life but for
		me that couldn't be further from the truth. Hands down for me the best
		years I've had so far have been at University.</p>

		<p>I've got my accommodation sorted for my final year now but I still
		need to hand in my report reflecting on my placement year which is due
		in 3 days. I have done it! I'm not being the typical lazy student here!
		My report is done and I've written it up, I actually took the time to
		learn LaTeX and write it in that. I just have to wait for my review
		form to be filled out by my manager and then I'm good to go. I'm
		already thinking about what I want to do after University. I'm well
		aware that's a lone way away yet and I should really be focusing on my
		final year project and the subjects I've taken for my final year but
		it doesn't hurt to have some plans in mind. Speaking of...</p>

		<h3>Life after University</h3>
		<p>So although I still have a year of education ahead of me I have been
		thinking about what I want to do once I finish University. I've nailed
		it down to 3 decisions and 2 of them are very similar but I'm happy I've
		narrowed it down to 3. My first plan is the most obvious and that's to
		get a full time job and pursue my career. I know that's pretty standard
		but I think if I take that route I'm going to see how high I can climb
		in my career. Skies the limit and all that. The second option I have is
		to work part time and go back into education. I've been looking at some
		more University courses for computing and depending on how well my
		final year project Phantom goes I might try and get into a University
		that teaches programming language design and development. In my head
		that sounds so interesting and I'd love to learn some more specialist
		subjects like that. Either that or I do some other subjects. I'd love
		to improve some of my GCSE grades, I know I'm capable of getting much
		higher grades than a C but at the time, like most high school students I
		found it to be a very stressful experience that wasn't helped with
		teachers telling you every day that you're going to fail you life if
		you don't do well. Needless to say I didn't deal with that pressure
		very well and got C's in some of the subjects I really enjoyed like
		Maths, Chemistry, and Biology when I know I can do much better. Maths
		especially and University has proved that to me as I achieved 71% on my
		Maths module for second year. So I thought if I can do that I can get
		better GCSE grades for it and maybe take A level Maths and some other
		subjects. I'd love to do Psychology so maybe that can be on the list
		as well.</p>

		<p>The final plan is to work part time and well do what I want with the
		time off I have. Ideally I would love to work on my own projects or
		contribute to some open source projects to get a nice bit of variety of
		things to work on in the week. I love having a bit of variety in my work.
		I think it's one of the reasons I like working in DevOps as I can work
		on multiple platforms with different tech stacks. After all variety is
		the spice of life! That's the general idea of what I have planned for my
		life once I finish my course but a year is a long time and I might
		completely change my mind or find something else I want to do once I
		finish. Who knows? But it doesn't hurt to have some kind of backup plan.
		</p>

		<h3>Placement</h3>
		<p>I've got roughly 5-6 weeks left on placement now. I was originally
		supposed to finish at the end of this month but I managed to get my
		contract extended to help with the handover for my replacement. It feels
		very weird knowing that someone is going to replace me already. Like
		I said earlier I can't believe how quickly the time has gone. I'm
		hoping I can make the transition for the new placement student who takes
		my place as easy as possible for them. I'm hoping I can run through a lot
		of the things they'll need to know for the job and the other guys on the
		team can get the jobs they're working on in a nice state so working with
		the newbie can be easy for them as well. We're a very busy team in work
		and the smoother I can help make this handover the better for all of us.
		Honestly this placement year has been a fantastic opportunity for me and
		I've learned a lot from them. I hope the new placement student enjoys it
		as much as I did. It'll be a slightly more difficult start for them as
		we're still not able to work in the office because of the pandemic. But
		I do wish them all the very best of luck and my team as well.</p>

		<h3>Projects</h3>
		<p>So I have actually been managing to get through my list of projects
		slowly but surely. Although it is much easier to think of new things to
		do and add them to the list than it is to actually complete them. I've
		decided I want to make my own window manager. This isn't out of the blue.
		I've been using i3wm for a few months now and it is a great beginner
		window manager it does leave something to be desired. I think I'm going
		to give DWM a go first and then one day try and make my own window
		manager. It seems like a fun project and as it's my own project I can
		add as much bloat, I mean as many features I want to it. I've also
		decided I want to update the screenshots I have on my portfolio. I want
		to add something a bit more eye catching and more impressive looking. So
		that means I'm going to do some more complex / more GUI based projects.
		Which is great because I found a GUI library called Nuklear the other
		day which I want to try out. I also need to update the games projects
		section on my portfolio as the in progress project scorch hasn't had any
		development on it in a while and I've started a new project in Unreal
		called project impulse and once that looks a bit more impressive I'll
		put some images of that on my portfolio.</p>

		<h3>How I've been feeling lately</h3>
		<p>If I'm honest I have been feeling quite fed up as of late. I spend
		most of my time in my bedroom as I work, do projects, play games with
		friends, and read in my room and seeing the same 4 walls for so long is
		finally getting to me. These past few weeks my progress on projects has
		slowed right down almost to a standstill, my exercise routine has kind
		of gone down the drain, and I've been playing more games and reading
		less. Granted the latter has only happened this week as I've booked a
		week off work. This has given me chance to completely switch off and
		have a laugh online with my friends which I think I've really needed.
		Momentum should pick back up when I get back into work tomorrow and
		I it's alright to feel like this every once in a while. There's also
		nothing wrong with shutting off and having a week where you don't do
		anything. Close friends and family have said to me I work too much which
		I don't believe at all but they do have a point that I should take some
		more time off here and there. My argument always is if I'm working on
		projects it's not work to me because I enjoy it but in reality its still
		taking brain power and some things are difficult which means it's not
		relaxing. It's okay to take a day off to recharge. I don't need to do
		something productive 24/7.</p>

		<p>Anyway, I've managed to get every Friday off work now until I finish
		as I hard loads of holiday days left and I had to use them up. Not bad
		for some eh? I'm hoping I can get some of the todo list done for project
		impulse so I can talk about that in the next blog post. What'll be nice
		about having Fridays off now will be I can do whatever I want to that
		day. It'll be a nice little test run for one of my plans after finishing
		University. Now I just have to choose which projects I want to work on...
