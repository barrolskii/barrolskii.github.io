				<h1>Non-Programming Advice For Programmers</h1>
				<h2>A few things I think new programmers should know</h2>

				<time datetime="24-07-2021">JUL. 24, 2021</time>
				<p>I've been programmer for about 5-6 years now and I've run into
				problems that aren't always directly programming related but have
				affected me when programming. I was thinking about these issues
				and I thought to myself it would've been really good to know that
				how I felt or the problems I was running into are normal and that
				I shouldn't stress about them. So this is what this blog post is,
				a post about non-programming issues related to programming that
				I wish I knew about throughout my programming journey. Just as a
				side note I call these problems non-programming problems because
				some of them apply to other things apart from programming but this
				will still be a programming focused post. Anyway let's begin!</p>

				<h3>Take Your Time When Learning Something New</h3>
				<p>I've noticed a trend on YouTube where people try to challenge
				themselves and try to do a project in a specific amount of time.
				"I LEARNED X IN A WEEK", "RECREATING Y IN 2 DAYS" etc. It is
				impressive when someone does that but I don't think it's a good
				attitude to have when trying to learn and understand something
				new and it's really not a healthy attitude to have towards all
				learning. Everyone learns at their own pace. Some people are
				faster than others and that's okay. What matters most when you're
				learning something new is that you actually understand what you're
				learning. I've run into this problem myself when I was researching
				scripting languages. I took a week off work at the time and said
				that I was going to complete the write an interpreter in Go book
				within that week. That was the challenge for myself and I tried
				very hard to stick to it. No surprise to anyone I didn't complete
				the project within a week (I think it took me 9-10 days) and the
				worst part about it was when I did complete the project there were
				gaps in my knowledge about the subject due to me rushing through
				things. There is nothing wrong with taking your time when learning
				something new and if it takes you a long time that doesn't mean
				it is a bad thing. Sometimes you'll pick things up quickly and
				other times you won't. Don't put pressure on yourself and don't
				compare what you do and how you learn with other people or these
				YouTube videos of people learning things in a short amount of
				time. Learning should be fun and enjoyable and putting pressure
				on yourself trying to speed run learning a new and/or complex
				topic will only make the experience worse for you. Tackle the
				task at a pace you are comfortable with. You're learning this
				for yourself and not other people.</p>

				<h3>Take A Break</h3>
				<p>I'm guilty of not doing this now but take regular breaks from
				your computer and know when to stop. Countless times I've run
				into a bug when I've been coding all day and I think to myself
				"I'll fix this and call it a day". That doesn't always work. So
				many times have I spent needless hours torturing myself trying to
				fix an issue when I'm tried and fatigued from working all day when
				the best thing to do in that situation is to just call it a day.
				Remember the bug isn't going to fix itself overnight. It'll still
				be there when you wake up tomorrow. You will probably find as
				well you'll fix the bug quite quickly when you have a good nights
				rest and come back to the problem.

				Don't forget to take regular breaks as well when you're working
				at a computer. There are a whole host of health issues that occur
				when working at a computer and simply getting up and walking a short
				distance and having a stretch every 2 hours does wonders for you.
				We're not made to spend obscene hours sat down behind a desk. Take
				regular breaks. You physical and mental health will thank you for
				doing so. You'll also be able to take a step back from any issues
				you've run into and come back to it with a fresh mind. Take a break.
				It's good for you.</p>

				<h3>Do Other Things That Don't Involve Computers</h3>
				<p>This is a simple one but make sure you have other hobbies that
				don't involve being on a computer. Programming is a hobby of mine
				and also my career and I love playing games as well but it's not
				good to spend most of your time in front of a screen (trust me).
				Before lock down I used to snowboard regularly, go to the gym,
				read, and meet up with my friends. Not exactly super exciting stuff
				but it allowed me to actually be active and to see people. Get out
				and get some other hobbies even if it is just reading a book and
				going for walks. There's nothing wrong with taking a break from the
				computer.</p>

				<h3>Project Block</h3>
				<p>This is a more difficult one because this is different from
				person to person but project block sucks when you want to start
				a new project but you have no clue what to do. I've ran into this
				myself when I was a very inexperienced programmer where I wanted
				to do something cool but I didn't have the knowledge or any ideas
				of what specifically to do. I don't have a specific answer of
				what you should do but what I would recommend is using this rut
				to either progress your knowledge of a programming language, look
				at other projects people have done and try to do your own take
				on them, or find a problem that you have and try to make a program
				to fix it. Even if it is something simple it's good to do something
				and let your mind figure out what to do next. Also when you have
				project ideas note them down somewhere so when you don't know what
				to do you can look at your list of projects and pick one.</p>

				<h3>Don't Compare Yourself To Others</h3>
				<p>I find this is good to do in general and not just with programming
				but don't compare yourself to other people. That's a really easy
				way to make yourself feel down and inadequate. People will always
				do awesome things and you should use that as inspiration for yourself
				but don't look at other peoples achievements and think "I've done
				nothing compared to them" or "Why bother when there are people so
				much better than me?". You'll never be able to improve yourself
				when you're too busy comparing yourself to other people. Look
				where you are now compared to where you started. If you're not happy
				with your progress think why and try to push yourself a bit more
				so you can improve. Comparing yourself with others is an easy way
				to put unnecessary pressure on yourself. More than likely you're
				just putting to much pressure on yourself in the first place and
				that's why you're comparing yourself to others. Relax and take a
				step back. You're doing just fine.</p>

				<p>Also something that is related to this is if you don't know
				something that is not a weakness and asking others for help
				is not a weakness. It's great to want to figure out things on
				your own but when you really do get stuck and don't understand
				something ask for help. Wanting to gain more knowledge and better
				yourself is not a bad thing and people who make you think so are
				not nice people. Don't forget as well that people who know more
				than you about something are not a threat. You can learn from
				these people and better yourself from what they've learned. Do
				that. You can't do everything by yourself.</p>

				<h3>Do Difficult Things To Get Better</h3>
				<p>When I look back at my second year of university I really
				didn't consider myself to be a good programmer. I lived the
				typical student lifestyle in my first year and I was really
				behind the top students in my class in both skill and knowledge
				because I wasn't putting the time in with personal projects. So
				when I was on placement I gave myself projects and tasks
				only on Linux so I could learn a completely new tool set and to
				make sure I really understood what I was doing. My knowledge and
				skill as a programmer improved so much that I now actually work
				with the same people who were at the top of my class in university.
				If I didn't challenge myself and give myself projects that were
				difficult and tested my knowledge then I wouldn't have improved.
				I didn't try to undertake projects that I found difficult just
				to say I could but because I wanted to be good at what I do and
				to have the knowledge to back myself up. I would recommend that
				you do that too. If there is a project that you think oh I'm not
				good enough to do that you should do it anyway. If something is
				difficult it means it will push you to be your best and if you
				don't have the knowledge to tackle the task properly then you can
				find areas where your knowledge is lacking. If everything is easy
				then you don't have room to improve. Challenge yourself and push
				to improve and in time you'll look back and notice how much progress
				you have made.</p>

				<p>Hopefully some of that helps out. Everyone's learning journey
				is different so do what works best for you. This is stuff that
				would've helped me when I was putting too much pressure on myself
				and not feeling good enough. Remember to relax and don't be too
				hard on yourself. Everyone feels that way every once in a while.
				Just keep going and try your best.</p>
