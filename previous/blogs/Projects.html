		<h1>DWM, Impulse, And Portfolio Improvements</h1>
		<h2>A weekend of progress</h2>

		<time datetime="14-07-2020">JUL. 14, 2020</time>
		<p>Last week was the first 4 day work week of this month and it was
		really, really good. I managed to be apart of my very first release into
		a live server in work and with the Friday off I managed to get through
		some of my projects to do list. Not only that I was productive
		throughout the weekend and still managed to get a nice balance between
		being productive and doing the things I like to do to relax. This is the
		most refreshed I've felt from a weekend in a long time. If I'm feeling
		like this now I hope this is a sign of good things to come.</p>

		<h3>Friendship ended with i3, DWM is my best friend now</h3>
		<p>I've been meaning to try out a new window manager for my ThinkPad for
		about over a month now but after work I didn't really make the time to
		sit down and install a new one. Well on the weekend I finally got around
		to trying DWM and honestly it's my new favourite thing. I've been using
		i3 for a while now, I think I installed it back in January of this year?
		i3 is a nice window manager to use for getting into them and I had some
		good use out of it but I think around March I started feeling like I
		wanted something a bit more but I couldn't put my finger on what
		exactly. Turns out what I was missing was the ability to customise the
		window manager to whatever I want.</p>

		<p>So I finally got round to cloning DWM and adding a few extra bits
		and pieces to it already and it's been great fun. I was really surprised
		by how easy it is to apply suckless patches to suckless software. I need
		to have a browse through the available patches to see if anything
		tickles my fancy for my build of DWM. I haven't got a lot put into my
		build at the moment. For DWM itself I've applied the autostart patch
		so I don't have to manually restart my compositor and nitrogen to
		display my background. I've also grabbed dwmblocks and written a few
		scripts for it so I can have a display bar that contains the info I
		actually care about. It's not the prettiest looking thing at the moment
		so I'm going to have sort that out soon.</p>

		<p>So far though the transition from i3 to DWM has been really easy,
		far easier than I thought it was going to be. Customising it is so
		easy as well. You have to modify the source code if you want to add any
		other features which does put some people off but the code base is so
		small and well organised it's a breeze to do. It's even better that I'm
		comfortable with C which is what DWM is written in! So looking through
		the source code won't be an intimidating experience.</p>

		<h3>Project: Impulse</h3>
		<p>In my last <a href="https://barrolskii.github.io/blogs/Whatsup2.html">
		blog post</a> I briefly mentioned that I'm working on a new project
		in Unreal. Well on Friday I managed to finish the to do list for the
		prototype and got a working build of the project. I don't have any
		screenshots of the project as of now and that's mainly because the
		playable version is a rough prototype and it doesn't look nice at all
		but progress is being made on it. A new to do list has been made and I
		think it's safe to say the game in now moving into the pre-alpha stage.
		</p>

		<p>It's nice to see the project slowly coming along but I still need to
		spend way more time within the Unreal Engine. I'm getting more
		comfortable with the engine but I still wouldn't say I'm confident with
		it right now. I know this'll come with time and I follow a few channels
		on YouTube that do tutorials in Unreal so that should help speed up the
		process. I've limited myself in this project to try and use blueprint
		only (Unreal's visual scripting) as much as I can. This is just so I
		don't waste time trying things within C++ and jump down rabbit holes
		of trying to implement things that aren't needed or trying to extend the
		editor when I don't need to. As good as the blueprint system is I do
		wish there was support for adding components like that via a scripting
		language like Lua. I'm not sure if the engine does support something like
		that and I just haven't looked into it but if I had the choice I'd
		rather write a script than create something with visual scripting.
		Might be worth looking into in the future but blueprint works perfectly
		fine for now.</p>

		<h3>Project improvements</h3>
		<p>I had a look at the projects that I've listed on my portfolio and I
		noticed that they don't look eye catching. The software projects page is
		also lacking quite a bit. I've only got 2 projects on there at the
		moment. Plus they don't look too impressive only because they're command
		line based programs with no user interface. Which let's be honest is not
		eye catching for most people. After seeing this I decided I'm going to
		make existing projects look a bit nicer and integrate UI options for
		programs that I've made to work on the command line. The other day I
		found a C GUI library called nuklear which is a single header file
		library consisting of roughly 18k lines of code. I'm going to have a
		play about with the library and if I like it I'm going to add it to my
		book organiser so I have the option to either use it from the command
		line or have a nice user interface to sort out my books.</p>

		<p>Another set of improvements that I want to make are on the games
		projects page. I've got an old project on there called project scorch
		which I started a long time ago to learn Unreal C++ and it really helped
		with my University group project at the time, but I haven't picked the
		project back up for a while. I don't think I want to completely abandon
		the project and I will probably pick it back up one day but because I
		haven't touched it in such a long time I think it's best if I take it
		down for now. Actually I could replace it with Impulse when I have some
		decent looking screenshots to show off. I would like some more Unreal
		based projects to be on my games projects page, not just games but some
		engine plugins that extend the editor and add useful tools. Problem is
		I can only make those when I know what I need and at the moment I have
		no clue what tools I want to make.</p>

		<p>I have got a good place to start with getting into Unreal more. A
		little while ago I bought a bundle from Humble Bundle for game dev
		courses that give you some interesting projects to try in Unreal. One
		of the courses I have says it a maths based course which is fantastic
		for me because I've been wanting to improve my maths skills for quite a
		while now. The biggest drawback for me when implementing things in Unreal
		is when I have to get into maths. Don't get me wrong I do enjoy maths
		but I'm so out of practice with it, it'll go good to get into a course
		that'll refresh my memory with it and also show some cool practical
		applications of it within the engine. It'll really help with getting into
		the engine a bit more and hopefully I'll be able to see if there are any
		engine plugins that I can try and make to make things a bit easier for
		me.</p>

		<p>I'm thinking of starting the Unreal course either Thursday or Friday
		depending on how work is this week. I'll try nuklear out in the week
		and get round to updating the book organiser as well before I add a UI
		component to it. That will be a good opportunity to make the project a
		bit more modular. Maybe I could make a utility library for koios. One
		thing at a time first. I really must stop making more projects for
		myself so often.</p>
