		<h1>YCM Autocomplete Fix</h1>
		<h2>Fixing C and C++ auto-completion suggestions</h2>

		<time datetime="13-11-2020">MAY. 13, 2020</time>
		<p>I'll get straight to the point here, if you've installed the
		<a href="https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe">YouCompleteMe</a>
		plugin for Vim and/or Neovim, you might've run into a problem with C
		and/or C++ auto-completion suggestions. The big issue you may have run
		into just like me and a bunch of other people is that you're not getting
		standard library suggestions and language syntax suggestions.
		I've found a way to fix it.</p>

		<h3>The fix</h3>
		<p>The fix itself is really simple. Put this snippet of code into your
		.vimrc or your init.vim file if you use Neovim:</p>

		<pre>

let g:ycm_semantic_triggers = {
	\ 'c': [
	\	'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h',
	\	'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p',
	\ 	'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x',
	\	'y', 'z'],
\}
		</pre>

		<p>This might be a bit of a hacky way to do it. So what this does is
		sets all the lexicographic characters to trigger ycm. By default for C
		and C++ has the dot (.) and arrow (->) operators as the semantic
		triggers. As these are the default for the languages, you don't need
		to add them to our list. Now I'm not sure if this is the best way
		to get the auto-completion to work but I found this way it actually
		suggests standard library functions and primative types and functions
		I've already declared. It'll also show function arguments instead of
		just showing the function name.</p>

		<p> If you want this to work with C and C++ you just have to add
		C++ like this:</p>

		<pre>

let g:ycm_semantic_triggers = {
	\ 'c,cpp': [
	\	'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h',
	\	'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p',
	\ 	'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x',
	\	'y', 'z'],
\}
		</pre>

		<p>There is one thing that you need to make sure you have. For ycm to
		work for a project, it requires you to have a .ycm_extra_conf.py file
		for each project. I don't do this, I have a config file for each
		langauge in a config directory and source that when I edit a file
		based on its extension, like so:</p>

		<pre>

augroup filetype_c
	autocmd!

	let g:ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf = '~/.config/nvim/config/.ycm_c_conf.py'

	...
augroup END
		</pre>

		<p>I won't go over the setup of a ycm conf file here but there's an
		exmaple on the ycm
		<a href="https://github.com/rasendubi/dotfiles/blob/master/.vim/.ycm_extra_conf.py#L51">
		GitHub.</a> I've also based my configs off
		<a href="https://github.com/rasendubi/dotfiles/blob/master/.vim/.ycm_extra_conf.py">
		this</a> config on GitHub. You do have to change some things in the
		flags list and that's the '-std' and 'x' flags. These change depending
		on which version of C and C++ you're using. Here's what I have for C:
		</p>


		<pre>

BASE_FLAGS = [
        '-Wall',
        '-Wextra',
        '-Werror',
        '-Wno-long-long',
        '-Wno-variadic-macros',
        '-fexceptions',
        '-ferror-limit=10000',
        '-DNDEBUG',
        '-std=c99',
        '-xc',
        '-DUSE_CLANG_COMPLETER',
        '-I/usr/include/'
        ]

		</pre>

		<p>Here's what I currently have for C++:</p>

		<pre>

BASE_FLAGS = [
	'-Wall',
	'-Wextra',
	'-Werror',
	'-Wno-long-long',
	'-Wno-variadic-macros',
	'-fexceptions',
	'-ferror-limit=10000',
	'-DNDEBUG',
	'-std=c++11',
	'-xc++',
	'-DUSE_CLANG_COMPLETER',
	'-I/usr/include/'
	]
		</pre>


		<p>Hopefully that has fixed the problem for you as it did for me. I've
		seen a few posts online and a few videos on YouTube of people saying
		they haven't been able to get ycm to work for C and C++. Again I
		don't know if this is the best way to get this to work but it can
		stay as a workaround for now until someone finds a better way to
		do so.</p>
