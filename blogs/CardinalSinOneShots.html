				<h1>Cardinal Sins Of Game Design</h1>
				<h2>One shot kill AI</h2>

				<time datetime="29-12-2020">DEC. 29, 2020</time>
				<p>I've decided to start a series of blog posts about different
				design decisions or game mechanics that I have a strong opinion
				against. I'm a very opinionated person and like most people have
				a passion for all things games so naturally I have a lot to say
				about the subject. So this series is going to be about the
				design choices and mechanics in games, why I think specific ones
				are bad, and how I think they can be improved. This won't be a
				series of posts of me just shouting my frustrations into the
				void. I'll only make posts when I can give constructive feedback
				on how these things can improve and justify why these things are
				bad. There are enough people in games with no experience (I'll
				admit here I have no professional experience in games) who give
				their opinions out with no justification for why they think
				something is bad or how they think it can be improved. I refuse
				to be another one of those people and so I'm starting this
				series to get my thoughts out there. The other benefit of this
				is I can at the same time vent my frustrations. So with that out
				of the way let's get into the first cardinal sin of games
				design: enemy AI that can one shot kill the player.</p>

				<h3>The Problem</h3>
				<p>Now before I get into why I think one shot kills are bad I
				just want to say that this does not include multiplayer. Games
				like Rainbow Six: Siege, CS:GO, and many many more allow
				players in a player versus player (PvP) environment to one shot
				kill each other. This post is only covering player vs
				environment scenarios (PvE). Although multiplayer games do
				deserve a post of their own this one is only going to focus on
				single player and cooperative games where the players are
				against AI controllers.</p>

				<p>So this cardinal sin is when an AI enemy can kill the player
				in one shot regardless if the player has full health. I also
				find that if a player gets one shot when at or above half health
				is a bad thing and also rather annoying. The main reason I think
				this is a bad thing is due to the player being unable to react
				to the attack that just hit them. This has happened countless
				times to me in games like Gears 5, and God Eater. In a cover
				based shooter like Gears 5, my positioning can be great, I can
				even be in an optimal position and have the upper hand over the
				AI that I am fighting. But then due to difficulty and poor
				weapon balance I can get unlucky, get shot once while at full
				health and die. Thus forcing me to restart from a previous
				checkpoint and be punished for doing nothing wrong aside from
				just being unlucky. This causes a very frustrating experience
				as there is nothing the player can learn from the situation.
				You just have to keep trying at the situation and hope that
				you eventually succeed.</p>

				<p>Another reason I don't like one shots is that they punish
				the player too much for taking risks. A big part of boss fights
				or general combat in games is quickly weighing up risk versus
				reward. Should I peek and take out an enemy now? Should I
				reposition to get a better vantage point to deal more damage?
				When in game these are quick decisions that you need to make
				and when enemies can one shot you regardless of what your
				current health is then it turns from risk versus reward to
				risk versus risk.</p>

				<h3>The Loss Of A Power Curve</h3>
				<p>When lots of enemies can simply kill the player in one shot
				or in one hit the game loses the power curve that the game is
				supposed to set up. Borderlands 2 is a big offender of this
				with its basic mobs being able to one shot you in the late game
				although it does have a good mechanic to deal with this which
				I'll talk about later. Gears 5 and Gears of War 2 are great
				comparisons for bad and good enemy and game design. In both
				titles there is a revolver called the boltok and a sniper
				rifle called the longshot. When I played the campaign during
				launch (I'm not sure if this has changed in a patch) both
				of those guns could one shot the player. There was one mission
				in particular that I remember when you were put up against
				multiple AI controlled enemies that had this revolver and they
				could all kill you in one shot. You had no time to react, you
				couldn't go down and get revived for a second chance. Once you
				were shot you were dead.</p>

				<p>If you go back and play Gears of War 2 the boltok and the
				longshot don't one shot you. They are given to enemies that
				have specific roles and these roles are poke damage. The
				boltok on the hardest difficulty takes roughly 3 shots to kill
				the player and has a very slow rate of fire in that game. The
				gun is given to an enemy called the bolter who does not have a
				lot of health but is very quick. These enemies are designed to
				rush the player and try and either soften them up or finish
				them off if they have low health. To make this fair on the
				player they have low health so they can be killed very quickly.
				Here is a great example of a risk versus reward design. You
				know this enemy does a lot of damage but can be killed quickly.
				They are a glass cannon but do you focus on killing them or are
				the other grunt units more of a thread to you in the current
				firefight? The snipers are similar to the bolters but they tend
				to camp in one spot and try to snipe the player. Although they
				do a lot of damage to the player on the hardest difficulty they
				don't one shot the player at full health. If a player at full
				health gets shot by a sniper they are then put into one shot
				range so even a basic locust soldier can kill the player in one
				shot if they peek over cover and take damage. Both of these
				enemies are example of good design in a power curve as they
				remain a threat to the player with how much damage they can do
				without needing to kill the player outright in one shot. It
				allows the player to weigh up risk versus reward with
				prioritising different enemies during a firefight and can
				punish players for making mistakes without being completely
				unfair to the player and ruining the experience.</p>

				<p>Halo 2 and Halo 3: ODST have this same issue. Halo 2
				on legendary has these famous snipers that can one shot the
				player. They almost always have the high ground and once they
				see you, you usually can't react quick enough to kill them.
				The way you beat them is by learning where they spawn and pre
				fire them and hope you get a checkpoint in-between so you don't
				get punished too much when you inevitably get killed by one of
				them. Halo 3: ODST on the other hand has snipers that can kill
				you in two shots instead of one. If you are at full health and
				get shot by one it will take a big chunk out of your health but
				allows you to quickly move back into cover and it gives the
				snipers position away. This is another example of risk versus
				reward because you can make the decision to either peek and try
				and kill the sniper which would also risk killing you or you can
				try and reposition to flank the sniper and get the kill. You can
				see the similarities here where the better design lets the
				player know there is a sniper looking for them without punishing
				them for learning that they are there. </p>

				<h3>How This Can Be Improved</h3>
				<p>Personally I think that the fix is rather easy. First don't
				allow or give enemies damage values that are greater than the
				players health. If a player has a max health value of 100 don't
				give weapons over 100 damage. I understand that making a game
				feel fair but difficult is a hard thing to achieve but there are
				simple tweaks you can do that can help you achieve that. In my
				opinion a game that is regarded as easy with good design
				is always going to be better than a game that is regarded as
				very difficult because of bad design. If rebalancing enemies
				damage is too much of a task and is seen as "not worth the
				effort" (although I'd regard it as a high priority as this
				directly effects the players experience) then you can always
				just add a simple check before damage is applied to the
				player. Is the result of the current damage calculation higher
				than the players max health? If yes then significantly reduce
				the damage. If you want to be really lazy then hard code a
				value that it is set to rather than recalculate the damage. I
				wouldn't encourage this but it's better than allowing one shot
				kills on the player to remain in the game.</p>

				<p>Another improvement to this could be invincibility frames.
				Sometimes in games you can be technically one shot without
				having a single enemy do so. I found I ran into this problem
				during the late game of God Eater. I would be fighting an enemy
				one on one and the damage they were doing to me (I thought) felt
				fair. I was being punished for not reading attack patterns and
				not blocking but I wasn't being killed in one shot for making
				mistakes. It felt like a good back and fourth fight. Or it did
				until another enemy showed up and hit me into an attack that
				when they were put together drained me from full health and
				put my character into a downed state where all I could do was
				sit there and wait for a revive or wait for the respawn timer
				to count down to 0. This has happened to me more times than I
				can recall but it is a very annoying situation where I'm
				technically not being one shot but at the same time I am as it
				is a combo of attacks that I can't block. Once you are hit
				you are in a vulnerable state to still being attacked and
				during late game attacks can wipe your health out rather
				quickly. A simple fix for this would be invincibility frames.
				Most people know about these from the Dark Souls games but
				in that series they only occur during a certain point of a roll
				animation. In this scenario these would be applied when the
				player is vulnerable and unable to move. This protects the
				player from a combo that will wipe all their health out while
				they are unable to defend themselves from it. Once they are
				able to move again they can then defend themselves from other
				attacks. I don't think killing the player when they are unable
				to defend themselves makes for a fun or interesting experience.
				This can make the fight still seem fair but also not take
				away from the difficulty. The player still has to fight the
				two or more enemies in the level but it stops the player from
				being bullied by the AI and allows them to have a better
				fighting chance.</p>

				<p>The last improvement which I mentioned I would talk about is
				a mechanic called health gate in Borderlands 1 and Borderlands 2
				(I do like to go on about that series don't I?). This mechanic
				was first introduced in Borderlands 1 for the raid boss
				Crawmerax in the Secret Armoury Of General Knoxx DLC. Gearbox
				said they had to introduce the mechanic as the boss was so
				powerful that when players entered the arena to fight him they
				would immediately go down from an attack. So they introduced
				health gate to stop players from being killed by the boss in
				one hit so they had a fighting chance with him. This mechanic
				was then carried over into Borderlands 2 and was a requirement
				for the ultimate vault hunter difficulty as even basic mobs
				had the potential to one shot kill you. Without this mechanic
				the end game for Borderlands 2 would truly be unplayable and
				in Borderlands 1 the fight with Crawmerax would be unplayable.
				Now I know you can say just balance the game or the bosses
				properly and I agree with that but it is a nice mechanic to
				have just in case there are situations where the player can
				be one shot killed. Health gate stops multiple enemies teaming
				up on you and downing you before you can react. So its not just
				a mechanic to stop an overpowered enemy. It can be used to stop
				unfair situations against the player.</p>

				<h3>Cases When This Is Okay</h3>
				<p>Now I will admit there are cases when one shot kills are okay
				against the player. Granted a think there are only a few
				situations where it should be allowed but if done right it can
				be okay to do. I think a one shot kill is okay for a story
				reason. Let's say that you are playing through a campaign and
				the big bad boss is introduced at the start and you have to
				fight them. If you want to show the player that at the start
				they are weak and the boss is incredibly strong and they will
				have to train to defeat them, then a one shot kill is okay in
				this situation. It doesn't mean the player should be one shot
				during the final fight but to emphasise the bad guys power
				you can do it this way.</p>

				<p>Another reason which I'll be honest is in a grey area for me
				is forcing the player to go into a specific path. Dark Souls
				kind of does this (I say kind of because you can beat every
				boss without being hit once. Trust me there are videos of
				people doing it) as you can go into a boss room, straight away
				be one hit by the boss, and then the player will (hopefully)
				realise they aren't strong enough right now and they should
				come back later when they have better gear and/or a stronger
				character. Fallout New Vegas does a similar thing at the start
				of the game. You are told to make your way to New Vegas but if
				you go north straight to New Vegas (this is granted if you
				survive the Cazador bombardment) you have a high chance of
				meeting Deathclaws who, at this early on in the game, will
				kill you in one hit forcing you to take another route to New
				Vegas. I'm not a big fan of seeing this, especially in open
				world games that say they allow you to play the game as you want
				but if you want to force a player a specific way then this is
				one way to do it. Like I said this is a grey area for me
				because I understand why people do it but it doesn't mean I like
				it.</p>

				<h3>A Side Note</h3>
				<p>Just before I end this post I just wanted to ramble on about
				a few things. So when a player gets one hit unfairly by an AI
				character I refer to it as "getting fly swatted". Where in this
				case the player is the fly and the AI is the person holding the
				swatter. You never want to be in the place of the fly but rather
				the place of the person holding the swatter. Being the fly in
				that scenario is not fun and I find thinking about it that way
				allows you to take a step back and think "am I the fly being
				swatted in this situation?". If you are then you need to sort
				out what is happening in the game for this unfair and unfun
				situation to occur. People forget that games are meant to be
				fun. You can still have difficulty in games and have the game
				remain fun. You just have to do it the right way.</p>

				<p>Last thing before I go is that I'm trying to improve my
				writing skills and the quality of these blog posts. As you can
				probably tell, writing is not my strong suit as my spelling and
				grammar are mediocre at best but I'm really trying to make a
				conscious effort to improve. I'm hoping this new cardinal sins
				series will help me improve my writing and how my blogs are
				structured. I feel that they are ordered out logically and that
				my thoughts are articulated well enough but I am aware that
				there is plenty of room for improvement. I'm not going to make
				any promises to when the next post of cardinal sins is going to
				be but it'll be out when it's ready. Or when I can be bothered
				to write one. Until then I'll be enjoying the rest of my
				Christmas break before the bombardment of university work comes
				back to hit me. This is the best time of year to play games and
				eat nothing but chocolate.</p>
