		<h1>A Small Update</h1>
		<h2>Ramblings from a man in quarantine</h2>

		<time datetime="18-04-2020">APR. 18, 2020</time>
		<p>I haven't written a blog post in quite a while, I think it's been just
		over a month now and as lock down is in full force what better time than to
		write a little update of what I've been doing.</p>

		<h3>What's up doc?</h3>
		<p>Well to put it simply I've been very very busy. Work has been picking
		up pace over the past month. Which to be quite honest I'm glad about as
		the work I've been tasked with was a slow process. I'm not allowed to say
		exactly what I've been working on but let's just say things are going well
		and it's all coming together now. I've been keeping myself busy in my free
		time with projects, books and trying to maintain an exercise routine. Keeping
		the routine while in lock down I've found has been easier said than done. I'm
		glad I have so much to keep me busy while in lock down because some people
		don't seem to have a lot to do so I consider myself very lucky there.</p>

		<h3>Book organiser</h3>
		<p>I've put some more work into my book organiser and I can say safely this
		time that it is in a good state. I need to do a blog post about what I've
		done and what I want to add next but the project itself is in a good state.
		I'll be honest and say the quality of code is not looking great at the
		moment. There does need to be some refactoring in places and some general
		clean up but the project is going well. All I need to do now is have a run
		with my digital library and I'm good to go.</p>

		<h3>Desktop ricing</h3>
		<p>I like to use vim when I can and I've been putting a decent amount of
		effort into adding to my .vimrc when I need to add more features. The one
		issue I've found is keeping all my config stuff up to date between my work
		laptop, my personal laptop and my desktop. So I put the time to have all
		these machines use my Mint-Rice repo for the config files. It's a pretty
		simple setup, the .vimrc and the .bashrc (and any other configs) simply
		have one line that sources the necessary config file. This way if I add
		any changes to the config files it'll be in one place and all I'll have
		to do is push the changes and then pull them on different machines. I
		might look into automating the pull process actually. That'll save me
		the hassle of doing it myself. </p>

		<h3>Phantom</h3>
		<p>Phantom is another project I need to do a blog post about but Phantom
		is in a working state. It's not where I would like it to be at the moment
		but it's in a good state. I'm keeping the project in GoLang for the time
		being just so I can implement the features I want. No point in starting
		from scratch again. Plus this allows me to make design decisions sooner
		rather than needing to make them during my final year. The less work I
		need to do and the less stress I put on myself for my final year of
		university the better.</p>

		<h3>C libraries</h3>
		<p>While we're on the topic of Phantom, as I'm going to be making the
		actual project in C (don't know if I've mentioned this but I've
		decided it's going to be in C now) I'm going to need some libraries
		to help with functionality. Only there is a catch. I wan to write the
		libraries myself. If I can avoid it I don't want to use third party
		libraries. I already know of two libraries I'm going to need already
		which is great because I can start working on them as soon as I want.
		The two libraries I'm going to need are a hashtable (dictionary,
		hashmap, whatever your preferred name for them is) library and a
		garbage collection library. I've had a little read of the K&R C book
		and it surprised me how simply a hashing function can be implemented in
		C so that should be a nice little project to do. The best part about this
		thought is that I've done a project on implementing a garbage collector in
		C. I followed a Udemy course a little while back during the finishing point
		of my second year. We were told we had to show off a personal project at the
		end of six weeks and I found this course a little earlier and decided to do
		that. I'm not going to use that project itself. What I want to do is make a
		library that I can reuse for different projects in C, not just for Phantom.
		That does mean starting a new project for it but to be quite honest I don't
		mind. I think it'll be nice to go back and see how much I've learned since
		I finished that project.</p>

		<h3>Unreal engine 4</h3>
		<p>As a way to unwind after work I've started messing around in the unreal
		engine. I'm not starting any projects (I still have one to finish in it but
		shhhhh we won't talk about that) right now but simply just messing about
		and trying to make cool things and following tutorials as well. Sometimes
		after work I don't want to play games because I find I get super frustrated
		with them so easily after work and sometimes I just don't feel like reading
		right after work. I've found unreal to be a really nice way to unwind after
		a long or frustrating day of work and I can just chill out and let myself
		unwind. I haven't been doing anything spectacular in the engine, I've
		mostly just been making materials for the first person gun mesh and applying
		different weapon skins to that. I know it's not exactly a difficult thing to
		do but I've found it oddly satisfying just to make nice patterns with pretty
		colours and adding it to my weapon skin collection wall. If I can remember
		I'll take a screenshot and add it to this blog post to show off. Really
		seeing all the colours is oddly pleasing. I do want to have some projects
		made in unreal finished and available one day but I've got so much going
		on right now that it's not going to happen any time soon. But in the mean
		time I'm going to continue to make pretty patterns to relax.</p>

		<h3>Forked!!</h3>
		<p>I had one of my Git repos forked! You might be saying to that, "So what?"
		and I mean yeah it's not a big deal but I did find it rather odd. Mainly
		because I don't really make projects for other people to use at the
		moment. I might do in the future but right now the projects I upload to my
		GitHub are for me. I do keep most of them public if people want to have a
		look and/or download them but I never thought somebody would. The other
		thing is it's not a project that I'm particularly fond or proud of. I mean
		I removed the project from my portfolio because I thought it looked way too
		ugly and that it was too simplistic. But for some reason somebody has forked
		the project. Honestly the only reason it's on my GitHub is because I forgot
		to delete it. Well let's hope that the person who forked it makes a better
		version than the one I made. I'm usually very critical of my work even when
		I do something that I'm told is good but I've got a streak of perfectionism
		so I'll never be fully happy with what I've made but that project is
		honestly not a good project. I only did it as a last minute thing because I
		was bored and had nothing I wanted to do. Maybe that's why the project, was
		bad, because I didn't really want to do it in the first place. Oh well at
		least I won't do something on the whim like that again. Or let's hope not.</p>

		<h3>Speed reading</h3>
		<p>As April is slowly coming to an end and I've still got two weeks left of
		holiday leave in work I think I'm going to take some time off in the
		beginning of May. I'm not going priorities the time off to work on Phantom
		like I did last time. Rather I'm going to try to learn to speed read. I have
		a book on speed reading that I read the first chapter of months and months ago.
		Sadly I never got very far with it as I was balancing a lot of stuff at that time
		(uni work mostly, nothing personal) so I didn't end up going very far with it.
		I feel my reading speed has increased as I've started reading more but I'm
		still not happy with it. All of a sudden I've turned into a massive book worm
		and I want to read as much as possible. This has probably come about as I
		avoided reading as a teenager as much a possible. So the higher my reading
		speed, the more books I can get through and the more useless knowledge I
		can retain. If you know me I am full of useless knowledge and I love knowing
		useless things so the more knowledge I can gain like that the better. With
		how well Phantom went within the week I dedicated to it I feel that if I
		dedicate a week to learning how to speed read I should be able to learn
		so useful stuff that week. So that should be a fun week and if I have
		anything interesting or cool to talk about then I'll probably make a blog
		post about it.</p>

		<h3>That's all for now</h3>
		<p>So that's mostly all I have to say from mid March until now. I'm
		keeping myself as busy as possible and with all these projects coming
		up I'm looking forward to all the new things I'm going to learn. I'm
		not looking forward to the frustration it will bring but hey it's not
		worth learning if it doesn't cause a bit of frustration and brain fog
		right? I have no idea when I'll post next but I need to do it soon.
		I've added some cool things to the book organiser and I want to talk
		about some other things I've got planned for it. I really should
		work on putting in some effort and give the project a better name...</p>
