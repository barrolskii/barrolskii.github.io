			<h1>Phantom</h1>
			<h2>So it begins</h2>

			<time datetime="24-03-2020">Mar. 24, 2020</time>
			<p>About two weeks ago I booked a week off work so I could concentrate
			on starting research for my final year project. I'm going to make a
			scripting language called Phantom which I have no experience of doing
			but that's the point of a final year project, to research something
			that's interesting to you and something that you can feasibly make.
			Anyway the cool thing is, is that Phantom is in a working state!</p>

			<h3>The learning process</h3>
			<p>I can't take any credit with this first working version of Phantom.
			During my week off I followed the book <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/">
			Writing An Interpreter In Go</a> by Thorsten Ball. This book was a really good
			read, it presents the concepts to make an interpreter in a clear and readable
			manner. Granted learning it this way is basically holding your hand through the
			learning process and you copy a lot of code but with how busy I am with work, side
			projects and my other hobbies, I thought there's nothing wrong with learning this
			way and at my own pace. It's okay to take things slow sometimes and the last thing
			I want to do is burn out from doing too much.</p>

			<h3>The Current state</h3>
			<p>As the title of the book says, Phantom is currently written in Golang, a language
			I'm not familiar with but it has a C like syntax so it wasn't hard for me to pick up
			as most of my uni programming experience is in C++ and C#. The language as it stands
			right now has a working interpreter (as you would expect as the book says that's what
			you'll learn to make) but most of the languages features and syntax are the same as
			what you learn in the book. I say most of because today I changed the let keyword for
			declaring variables to var, which changed absolutely 0 functionality of the interpreter,
			just the references of 'let' to 'var'. Not exactly rocket science. The language does
			have support for a few data types, operators, if statements, functions, arrays, maps
			(or hashtables, whatever you prefer to call them) and builtin functions. Which is
			a good amount to be taught but it does mean the language is missing a lot of other
			feature. I mean the current state of Phantom doesn't have a for keyword, classes
			or the char or float data types.</p>


			<h3>Don't worry, it's on the list...</h3>
			<p>Given that lots of features are missing that gives me the opportunity to implement
			them myself. No hand holding which is exactly what I want. It's a nice way to learn, to
			be guided through a topic but you can't rely on that forever. Even with the style of
			the book, I found myself skipping ahead, implementing functions, features and tests for
			the interpreter before I finished the current section of the book I was on. Which
			honestly showed to me how good the author was at explaining these concepts. They
			were put so clearly I had the confidence to go forward and carry on myself. Phantom
			still has a lot of work to be put into it and the current plan of action right now
			is to implement basic language features like the iteration support, classes and other
			primative data types.</p>

			<h3>What's after that?</h3>
			<p>I'm not going to be using the Golang version of Phantom for my final year project
			because that would be cheating after all. It could also be plagiarism if I do that.
			No, instead I'm going to make the language in C. Or C++, still haven't decided yet
			but it will probably be C. I've got a todo list in the works for the stages I want to
			tackle first and some other things I'll need in preparation. If I pick either C or C++
			I'm going to need to implement a garbage collector for the language. Which just as luck
			has it, I had a project a little while ago which was making a memory leak detector in C
			so I'll have to dig up that project and make some changes to it. See if I can make it have
			a generic interface to interact with so I can use it for other future projects and not just
			for the scripting language. Another thing I'll need to do is create a hashtable library if
			I'm going to implement it in C. C++ has its own hastable library as part of the standard
			library but C is one of the few languages that does not. I know I could use a library that
			is already out there but where's the fun in that?</p>

			<p>Either way my focus right now is going to be basic language features and then adding my own
			personal touches to the language. I had a great time with this inital bit of learning but now
			it's time to really get my hands dirty. My next post about Phantom is going to be showing off
			what I've added to it. Let's hope I show more than just basic language features...</p>
