		<h1>Down The Rabbit Hole</h1>
		<h2>Or how two asterisks wasted my day off</h2>

		<time datetime="11-05-2020">MAY. 11, 2020</time>
		<p>I decided to take a Friday off about two weeks ago, I built up enough
		flexi hours in work and I thought it was time to cash them in. I didn't
		plan to do much during my day off but I thought I might make a start on
		some of my projects that I wanted to do over the weekend.</p>

		<h3>The start of libash</h3>
		<p>I've decided to add another project on my list of projects, libash.
		While I'm doing research for my final year project named Phantom, I
		realised that a lot of the languages functionality that will be
		implemented in C, I might actually want to reuse it in other projects.
		An example off the top of my head is Phantom is going to require its
		own garbage collector. The application of a garbage collector won't
		just be useful in that single project but other projects that I will
		develop in the future. </p>

		<p>So I decided to make a repository called libash where I will store
		all these different C files in one place if I ever want to use them
		in different projects in the future. I might end up making a static
		library for it but I won't be making that right now. I found that this
		libash project gives me loads of freedom to try and implement things
		in C that either most popular libraries do for you or if I just simply
		want to try and make something myself. So the first thing I made was
		a hash table library.</p>

		<h3>How did it go?</h3>
		<p>Very well! Also quite quickly (I think). I had everything I needed
		for hash table implementation in under an hour. Now before I go on,
		if you're not familiar with hash tables (dictionaries, whatever you
		want to call them) I'm not going to be explaining what they are or how
		they work so just keep that in mind. Once I finished the implementation
		I then went to testing it to see if everything worked nicely. And it
		did... the first time. It would crash if I tried to reinitialise a hash
		table variable. I had a bug somewhere in my code and I had no idea
		where.</p>

		<h3>Time well spent</h3>
		<p>After spending more time than I'd like to admit trying to figure out
		where I went wrong I did end up fixing the bug. I went through that
		process I think most of us go through where we can't fix our code and
		question why are we even programming in the first place. That lovely
		little drama all over a tiny mistake. Turns out the issue was when I
		was initialising new items in the hash table. Here is the structure
		declaration of the hash table item:</p>

		<pre>
		<code>
typedef struct ht_item {
	struct ht_item *next;
	char *key;
	char *value;
} ht_item;
		</code>
		</pre>

		<p>And here is how I was allocating the memory for a new item:</p>

		<pre>
		<code>
static ht_item *ht_new_item(char *key, char *value)
{
	ht_item *item = malloc(sizeof(ht_item*));

	item->next = NULL;
	item->key = strdup(key);
	item->value = strdup(value);

	return item;
}
		</code>
		</pre>

		<p>See the problem? I'm allocating memory for a pointer to a hash table
		item, which on my system would be 8 bytes. The size I should be
		allocating is 24 bytes. Which is as simple as removing the asterisk
		in the sizeof operator.</p>

		<pre>
		<code>
static ht_item *ht_new_item(char *key, char *value)
{
	ht_item *item = malloc(sizeof(ht_item));

	item->next = NULL;
	item->key = strdup(key);
	item->value = strdup(value);

	return item;
}
		</code>
		</pre>

		<p>It's as easy as that. Now the reason the sub header says two
		asterisks is because I made the same mistake when allocating memory
		for a new hash table.</p>

		<h3>Lesson learnt</h3>
		<p>That wasn't the best start to a new project. At least I know now what
		to be careful of in the future. During this I did find a cool library
		called CRT (I found it on Windows, not sure if its on Linux) which helps
		you detect memory leaks in your program. Which honestly is pretty cool.
		Before I finish this small blog post I'll just give an update on what
		I've been doing. I've recently been obsessed with neovim and plugins for
		it. I've most recently installed youcompleteme which adds auto
		completion into vim. </p>

		<p>I did have an issue to start where it wouldn't show
		any functions that were part of the C standard library and after looking
		into it and watching quite a few videos people have been complaining
		about the same thing but I've managed to get it to work. I feel like
		the solution is a bit hacky but I think I'll post it nonetheless. That
		was another thing that I spent far too much time figuring out and if I
		can save someone a few hours I'll be happy. Other than that I've been
		working and doing bits of research here and there for Phantom and
		looking into other projects. I really should work through my todo list
		before I add even more to it though...
