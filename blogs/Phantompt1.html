			<h1>Phantom</h1>
			<h2>The scripting language to end all scripting languages (not really)</h2>

			<time datetime="10-02-2020">FEB. 10, 2020</time>
			<p>I have very little in the understanding of how both scripting and high 
			level programming languages are created and as I develop my skills as a 
			programmer my curiosity gets the better of me until I have to know the 
			nitty-gritty of how these things work. This has led me to decide that for
			my final year project in university I am going to create my own scripting
			language.</p>

			<p>From my inexperience with language design and creation (I say inexperience,
			I have no experience) this seems like a daunting enough task for me at the 
			moment. I have been reassured by a friend of mine that scripting languages aren't
			as bad as I'm thinking, granted this friend of mine is a far better programmer than
			me, she has reassured me that it's okay and that I'm more than capable to do it. 
			That reassurance is nice but it still makes me wonder how far I want to take the
			project. Do I stop at just a scripting language and an interpreter? Or should I go
			further than that and make my own basic programming language with its own compiler?
			I mean I want a reason to learn Haskell and writing my own compiler in Haskell sounds
			like a fun project and a great learning experience. But instead of getting ahead of
			myself I think I should probably stick to getting the scripting language working first</p>


			<h3>Where to start?</h3>
			<p>As I've had some time to think about this I've done a small bit of background research
			and come across a neat looking book my Thorsten Ball called <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/">
			Writing an Interpreter In Go.</a>Granted Golang is not going to be my language of choice for the
			project, (I have decided I'm going to write it in C++) what I will learn in this book will be 
			transferable to other languages.</p>

			<h3>So, why C++?</h3>
			<p>I've decided to go with C++ due to it being a language I'm comfortable using. For me it was a choice
			out of either C or C++ and in the end I decided to go with C++ as the standard library is to my 
			knowledge, more extensive than C which I'm hoping can make adding different functionality to the 
			language easier. Another added benefit is that I get to "Manage the memory like a real programmer"
			which I don't ever get to do with my current placement as my role involves a lot of scripting and
			using the .Net framework which manages the memory for you. I like manual memory management, it can
			be a fun skill to use, depending on the project of course.</p>

			<h3>The plan</h3>
			<p>So my plan currently is to follow the <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/">
			Writing an Interpreter In Go</a> book and create, I'm not even sure if it would be an alpha version,
			but I guess a v0.1 of Phantom in Golang (hey it's another language to add to my portfolio, who can
			complain about that?). I will need to book some time off work for this but I think a week should do 
			the trick. I'm not exactly trying to dethrone Python, Javascript, Lua or Ruby, so dedicating a week
			to learn should be enough to start. Then I should either create a version in C++ or I should have a 
			mess about and add some features that I want the language to have. That's another thing I've been
			making notes of what I like and dislike about the scripting languages I've used in work so far and I
			want to use some more so I can, I guess, cherry pick features I want or add features where I think,
			"that's crap, I could totally do that better" (I probably won't but that's not the point and who 
			knows I might surprise myself).</p>

			<p>By the end of this project I will be either an aficionado of many scripting languages or I will
			be so sick of scripting that I will for the rest of my life, program purely in Assembly as even
			the thought of using a scripting language again will send a shudder down my spine. Either way I'm
			looking forward to tackling this project and seeing where it goes. But before I even think about
			this projects future, I must learn to walk before I can run, and right now, I think I need to learn
			how to stand.</p>
