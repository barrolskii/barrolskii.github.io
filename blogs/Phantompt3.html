				<h1>Phantom</h1>
				<h2>Project update</h2>

				<time datetime="26-11-2020">NOV. 26, 2020</time>
				<p>It's been a while since I last wrote a blog post about
				Phantom (7 months to be exact, wow) so it's past due that
				I talk about how my final year project is going.</p>

				<h3>Project Progress</h3>
				<p>Since my last blog post about Phantom back in March a lot of
				progress has been made. Most of that progress has been during
				my first semester in university. The run up to university I
				didn't really focus on Phantom and instead I just concentrated
				on finishing my placement, working on other projects, and
				enjoying the time off before I started my final year.</p>

				<p>I've made some good progress with this project and Phantom
				is currently in a working state. Granted the language is very
				limited in what it can do in its current state. Right now it
				can only do basic arithmetic operations which makes the project
				a glorified calculator as of now. Not a very impressive final
				year project when I put it like that. I've carried out a lot
				more research for the project and I've managed to implement a
				bytecode compiler and a virtual machine. Originally the
				language was going to have an abstract syntax tree generated
				and then that tree would be evaluated by an evaluator.
				Instead after conducting more research and looking into what
				current scripting languages do like
				<a href="https://github.com/marcobambini/gravity">Gravity</a>
				and Lua, I decided to take take this route instead of the ast
				generation.
				</p>

				<p>Now I can't take credit for coming up with that idea of
				having Phantom include a compiler and a vm. This came from
				following the <a href="http://craftinginterpreters.com/">
				Crafting Interpreters</a> book by Bob Nystrom. cannot stress
				how valuable this book has been for me with this project. The
				topics that are covered in the book are explained so well and
				it's actually gotten me to research into these areas and as
				expected added a plethora of new books to the list of books I
				want to read. </p>

				<p>I'll be honest I haven't finished the entire book as I only
				wanted to follow it up to a certain point to get a grasp of
				some of the topics like compilers, vms, and garbage collectors
				and then implement them myself. I still go back and read over
				topics that I've either forgotten or I'm a bit hazy on but
				the projects codebase is branching away very quickly in
				similarity to what the books shows which I'm really happy with.
				The last thing I want is to take credit for work someone else
				has done. I actually want to learn and understand these topics
				and not just copy like a code monkey. Better to have a messy
				implementation first that works than just blindly copying
				someone else.</p>

				<p>Also in the last blog post about Phantom I mentioned I would
				be implementing the language in C++. Well I changed my mind on
				that and instead I've been using C instead of C++. Over the
				last few months I've enjoyed using C over C++ and C# so it only
				made sense to me to write my final year project in a language
				I enjoy using. Just thought I might mention that as a side
				note.</p>

				<h3>Features To Add</h3>
				<p>This project in my head has a rather large scope which is
				very unrealistic for me as I've got two other modules I need
				to work on at the same time as this project. If I only had
				to work on Phantom for this academic year I think it would be
				fine but all of these modules are introducing new subjects to
				me and the last thing I want to do is burn out trying to learn
				all the things. I've done that before and I can tell you it's
				not nice.</p>

				<p>So right now I need to implement the basics like variables,
				conditionals, and iterations. Obviously after that I'll need to
				add functions. All of this doesn't sound too bad and I know I
				can do it. I do need to add an internal hash table to keep track
				of all the global variables but that's pretty easy and I've
				already got a hash table implementation in C that I wrote a
				while ago so I'll just adapt that to the project. Other
				features I'd like the language to have are arbitrary precision
				integers or simply big ints as they're most commonly referred
				as. I'd also like an extensive arithmetic library that includes
				vectors, quaternions, matrices, etc. Not to mention regex
				support and a library of string utilities. Python has some nice
				string functions so that might not be a bad place to look for
				some inspiration. I totally mean inspiration and not ideas that
				I'm going to steal...</p>

				<p>So that's the update on Phantom for now. I know it's not a
				big update but I like to keep things small and concise. Plus
				writing about these things helps me keep a general idea of
				the direction the project is going. I've got a deadline coming
				up on December 18 so I'm hoping once that assignment is done
				(luckily it's the only deadline I have coming up) I should have
				some space to work on <a href="Officedash1.html">Office Dash</a>
				and add a new graphical front end to my book organiser.
				Until then though I shall be stressing out about my other
				university projects.</p>
