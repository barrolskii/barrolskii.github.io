				<h1>Office Dash</h1>
				<h2>My first solo Unreal Engine project</h2>

				<time datetime="08-10-2020">OCT. 08, 2020</time>
				<p>A few weeks ago I started a project in Unreal. I decided
				   I was going to make a game but to make sure that I don't
				   spend too much time jumping down rabbit holes I gave
				   myself a deadline to finish the project in under 2 weeks.
				   I managed to finish the project well under the deadline,
				   albeit the project did have a small scope and wasn't
				   exactly hard. That's besides the point though. I made
				   my first game in Unreal and I'm quite happy with it.</p>

				<h3>The Game</h3>
				<p>Office Dash is an 2.5D infinite runner. You play as a
				   disgruntled office worker who is tired of working a
				   9-5 job, being cooped up all day indoors, and feeling
				   underappreciated for their work. One day you decide
				   you've had enough of the tedium so you decide to quit
				   your job in the most dramatic way possible. By jumping
				   out of the nearest window and running across the
				   rooftops of adjacent buildings into the sunset. Along
				   the way you collect employee of the month trophies from
				   other offices so you can finally have something to show
				   for all your hard work. In game these trophies serve as
				   another way for you to get points to increase your score.</p>

				<h3>The Inspiration</h3>
				<p>There wasn't a direct inspiration for this game. I kind of
				   just decided one day that I was going to make an infinite
				   runner in Unreal. The last time I actually messed about
				   in a game engine for fun or to learn something new in my
				   own time was back during my second year of college when I
				   was learning to program. I used to make small little games
				   (the vast majority of which went unfinished I'll admit)
				   in the Love2D engine. I used to have a lot of fun with the
				   engine and it was one of the factors that helped me choose
				   to go on to study games programming at university.</p>

				<p>I noticed I stopped having so much fun with learning game
				   engines when I had to use one for my group project module
				   in my second year of university. Along with having a typical
 				   student life in first year (partying a lot) and working on
				   tests and assessments I got out of messing about and doing
				   small projects in a game engine just for fun. I realised I
				   really missed it and as great as my university course is,
				   it'll never be as much fun as if you decide to work on a
				   project yourself.</p>

				<p>So I decided I'd get back into games engines but this time
				   not on the lower level technical side that my course covers
				   ()although I do enjoy that don't get me wrong) and this time
				   round I'd use a more professional standard engine. It was a
				   toss up between Unity and Unreal but in the end I chose
				   Unreal as if a project does get me to write some C++, I'd
				   rather do that than C#. Nothing against C# but my personal
				   preference out of those two is C++.</p>

				<p>I found that the best part of this project was not only
				   having fun throughout but the satisfaction of seeing a
	 			   project to the end and watching it progress. I really did
				   miss making games. It was like being back in college again.
				   Except this time I'm not a complete noob and I have a
				   general idea of what I'm doing.</p>

				<h3>Future Support</h3>
				<p>During the development of the game I kept getting ideas of
				   more features to add to the game but I haven't implemented
				   as of yet just because I didn't want to feature creep. If
				   I didn't stop myself I'd probably still be working on the
				   project. I'm currently working on a new patch for the game,
				   version 1.1.0 is in the works and will be done very soon
				   so I'll make a blog post about that with the changelog.
				   I would like to put this game up on itch.io or maybe Steam
				   one day but sadly at the moment I can't.</p>

				<p>The reason I can't release the game (when I can it will be
				   out for free) is because of the background music I'm using.
				   I'm using a song called 20xx by Evan King. The song is under
				   the creative commons license but on his website he says to
				   get in touch with him if you want to use his music for things
				   like games, films, etc. I've tried to get in contact with him
				   but I've had no luck. Creative commons or not I still want to
				   respect the artist and the work he's done and I don't want to
				   release the game until I get the go ahead from him. So until
				   then we'll just have to wait and see and hopefully he gives
				   me the go ahead. Anyway, here's some screenshots of the game.
				   The next post about it will be the change log and plans for
				   subsequent updates.</p>
