				<h1>Office Dash</h1>
				<h2>Patch notes for version 1.1.0</h2>

				<time datetime="11-10-2020">OCT. 11, 2020</time>
				<p>In my <a href="https://barrolskii.github.io/blogs/Officedash1.html">
				last</a> blog post I talked about the game I made in Unreal and
				mentioned that in the next post I'll go over some plans for
				features to add in the future and go over a changelog of the most
				recent patch I've made for the game. Well this is this post so
				without further ado let's get into the changes!</p>

				<h3>Update 1.1.0</h3>
				<p>This update is a rather small update, only brining a few new
				additions to the game but further improving the games quality
				of life.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Moved player camera back further to increase field of view</li>
					<li>Updated platforms to have a new spawn point for detail variation</li>
					<li>Added a new set of office desks for the office interior</li>
					<li>Added a new green apartment platform with a different mesh</li>
					<li>Added a new cream apartment platform with a different mesh</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Just to elaborate on a few items in that list. The platform
				detail spawn point simply refers to the objects at the back of
				the platforms that are simply there to make the game a bit more
				detailed. There were originally part of the platform blueprints
				and couldn't be changed dynamically. By having this spawn point
				on the platforms, it allows the detail to vary between platforms
				and means the detail can be changed dynamically when the
				platforms are spawned in.</p>

				<p>The new set of office desks utilise this new spawn point
				that has been added to the platforms. I added this to the office
				interior as that had the most repetitive background in my
				opinion (although both the apartment and office exterior are
				arguably just as repetitive). This has added some variation in
				the office interior platforms but there are many more variations
				to come for each of the platforms.</p>

				<h3>Plans For The Next Patch</h3>
				<p>I'm currently working on a to do list for the next patch.
				I won't spoil everything here but I'll mention a few things I
				want to add to the game. First thing I'd like to add is the
				games title to the main menu. Not a huge change but just
				something I'd like to add. Second thing I'd like to add is a
				speed multiplier to the player HUD. Currently there isn't any
				sort of indication to how fast you are going. This'll also be a
				good chance to see if the increase in speed is too slow. Lastly
				I want to add a minimum spawn count for platforms. I've found
				quite often during testing that platform types will be too short
				and only have 3 platforms of one type spawn and then they change
				to a new one. I would like to add a minimum amount of platforms
				to spawn before the game is able to change the platform type.</p>

				<p>That's it for the time being on Office Dash. I'm not sure
				when the next update will be done for the game. I'm currently
				in my first semester of my final year in University and I'm
				still trying to get a nice balance between my course work, my
				hobbies, and personal projects. Hopefully it won't be too long
				and I'm hoping if all goes well I'll be able to talk more about
				other projects I've got ideas for and some of the projects I'm
				doing for University.</p>
