				<h1>Xbox Achievements</h1>
				<h2>A talk about the current state of achievements</h2>

				<time datetime="21-12-2020">DEC. 21, 2020</time>
				<p>A few days ago I finished the first semester of my final year
				at university and decided to boot up my Xbox One and play a few
				games to unwind. I've been swapping between Peggle 2, Lego Star
				Wars 2, and Gears of War 2 and I've noticed that getting
				achievements on the old Xbox 360 games is way more satisfying
				than getting achievements on the Xbox One games.</p>

				<h3>So How Are They More Satisfying?</h3>
				<p>Of course this is simply my opinion on the matter and I'll
				be up front about this but I do have a bias towards the Xbox
				360. I grew up playing the Xbox 360 and have fond memories
				of the console and the games I played while growing up. I'm
				sure there are kids and adults alike now who are going to get
				an Xbox Series X or S for Christmas, see that first achievement
				pop, and love it as I first did.</p>

				<p>Now there are a few things I found that I didn't enjoy
				about the current achievement system and the first thing is
				the notification sound. I find the current achievement
				notification sound to be too long and too drawn out. To me
				it seems like the sound is trying to make a big deal about
				you unlocking an achievement regardless of how long it took
				you to earn or how hard the achievement was. The Xbox 360
				sound on the other hand I found is short but long enough to
				grab your attention. The little ping (or bleep bloop if you
				watch Red Vs Blue) sound immediately grabs my attention and
				more often than not I'm disappointed to see a friend coming
				online for the 6th time that evening and not an achievement
				but when it is an achievement, from hearing that notification
				I want to see what I've just earned.
				</p>

				<p>Another thing I found that I dislike is the inclusion of
				rare achievements. One the Xbox One (and the Series S/X now)
				there are achievements that are marked as rare which will
				have a little diamond next to them to denote their rarity.
				When you unlock one of these achievements you also get a
				little diamond animation and a different notification
				sound which shows that you've unlocked an extra special
				achievement. Now an achievement can only be marked as rare
				if less than 10% of the community for that game have an
				achievement. This sounds good in practice but you'll
				quickly find that most of the achievements on a games
				achievement list are rare. This takes the magic away for
				what was supposed to be kind of a big deal. Now I do like
				the stats on achievements that Microsoft added with this.
				I find it interesting to see what percentage of people got
				certain achievements and I like the bragging rights that
				come with some achievements. If you got an achievement that
				only 0.01% of the community of that game got then you should
				be proud of that. Overall I found the rare achievement system
				a good idea in theory but in practice it falls apart.</p>

				<p>The next issue I found is when you get 100% of all
				achievements in a game. With the Xbox One all you get is a
				little message that says well done when you go onto the
				completed games achievement list. You get nothing else
				(aside from bragging rights). PlayStation awards you a
				platinum trophy that you can add to your trophy count but on
				Xbox you don't get anything which I find to be extremely
				disappointing. When you got 100% of the achievements on Xbox
				360 you actually got something. Now granted this is very limited
				and I'm pretty sure only you can see it but you got a little
				badge which was simply just the icon for the game added to
				your dashboard. If you open the menu icon to the right of
				play game from the dashboard where you can view your
				achievements you will see at the start a number showing the
				total amount of games you've completed along with the badges
				for each game. A simple thing but honestly I found it so
				satisfying to look at when I got 100% of the achievements for
				a game. Its like my little trophy wall of completed games.</p>

				<p>This last point is filled with nostalgia and bias but I still
				want to put it on here and that is I don't really like the
				achievement pop animation on the Xbox One. One thing I do want
				to say is that I think it's great that you can customise the
				colour of the achievement pop. More user customisation is hardly
				ever a bad thing and the more power to the user the better in
				my opinion. But it still doesn't change the fact that personally
				I don't like the basic or the rare achievement pop animation. I
				prefer the good old Xbox 360 animation.</p>

				<h3>Suggestions For Improvements</h3>
				<p>So I do have suggestions for the issues that I talked about.
				The first suggestion I have is to allow us to change the sound
				and the animation for achievement pops. Simply add the Xbox 360
				achievement notification sound and the animation and allow us
				to choose that instead of just being able to change the colour.
				I think this is a trivial change to add and it will go a long
				way for us 360 players who want to bring that nostalgia with
				us to the new generation.</p>

				<p>Another suggestion I have is addition of an achievement wall
				on our Xbox profiles. I'm thinking of a system similar to how
				Steam does it where you can show off the achievements you're
				most proud of and also allow you to show off what games you've
				completed alongside them. So not only can you show off your
				greatest achievements but you can show off your greatest
				completions as well.</p>

				<p>An issue I would like to see addressed as well is unobtainable
				achievements in games. When a game has multiplayer achievements
				they are usually only obtainable as long as the games servers are
				up. But when the servers go down and you can't host games locally
				you lose out forever in earning those achievements. There are
				also single player games that have unobtainable achievements
				which were never patched and will never be able to be unlocked
				unless someone cheats and risks getting their account banned.
				I personally think that if a developer makes achievements
				unobtainable either directly or indirectly, those achievements
				should be given to players. Now I don't think they should
				just be given over night to everyone that has the game. I know
				people don't really like the idea of this when they have earned
				achievements that are no longer available but they did at the
				time you could get them. I think that there should be an Xbox
				app available on the Xbox marketplace where you can choose to
				redeem the unobtainable achievements. That way if people want to
				get them they can and if people want to leave the achievements
				and not be given to them then they can choose to not get the
				app and the achievements will remain locked on their profile.
				Microsoft created achievements for Xbox and I believe (in my
				ignorance here, I know nothing about the achievement interface)
				that they have the power to implement a system like this.
				Achievements are fun to get when you get into it and finding out
				that the are loads of achievements that are impossible to get
				ruins the fun with a lot of games. This is a problem that can
				be fixed.</p>

				<p>The last suggestion and I kind of mentioned it in the last
				one is the inclusion of or extension of the little badges you
				could get for completing a game in the Xbox 360. Quite simply
				having some reward at the end of a completion other than just
				a message saying well done you got 100% of the achievements.
				I think having a badge at the end of a completion to show off
				and having a viewable list of them like in the Xbox 360
				dashboard would go a long way.</p>

				<p>Actually no I tell a lie this is the last suggestion. I'd
				like to be able to sort achievements by base game and individual
				DLC packs. I'm pretty sure you can do this on PlayStation and
				I think this would be a great feature to add. Now I'm not sure
				if this is to ever be included that a game's 100% achievement
				completion should count only from the base games achievements
				or the base game and the DLC achievements. I think the 100%
				should count from the base game and the DLC. Even though I do
				find it annoying when I've got 100% on a game and then find
				out a few weeks later that they've added even more achievements
				so my 100% is no longer valid. I think my view of that
				feature is subject to change. Maybe getting a badge for 100%
				all base game achievements and maybe mini badges for the
				DLC achievements might be a good idea. I should have a look into
				how PlayStation does it but either way categorising the
				achievements by base game and DLC will be a well welcomed
				feature.</p>
