				<h1>Battle Passes</h1>
				<h2>An overlooked problem in gaming</h2>

				<time datetime="07-02-2021">FEB. 07, 2021</time>
				<p>If you've played any popular game within the past three years
				you would've seen or been advertised a battle pass. Regardless
				of the games popularity or if it suits the games model, these
				passes are popping up everywhere. You'll have them guaranteed
				in any free to play battle royale to full priced AAA releases
				ranging from Gears 5, Call Of Duty, and now Sea Of Thieves. I've
				noticed a common pattern with all of these implementations of
				battle passes across a wide variety of games. They're all
				anti-consumer and everybody seems to be okay with that.</p>

				<h3>Popularised Anti Consumerism</h3>
				<p>So how are battle passes anti consumer? Granted at first
				they don't seem it. You pay a games company a small fee for
				their battle pass and you can unlock a lot of content from it.
				I'll admit the price for a lot of these passes and what you can
				actually get from them is really good value for money. They
				look like an even better value when you compare the price of
				the pass to individual microtransactions for skins and emotes.
				So if they're better than the alternative of microtransactions
				then how is it bad? They're bad because the passes themselves
				are time limited. Meaning if you don't unlock everything by
				a specific deadline then you can never earn that content again.
				Regardless if you paid for the pass or not, once its gone its
				gone.</p>

				<p>Battle passes are part of a bigger problem that is digital
				ownership. If you pay for a digital item do you own it? Or does
				the company who made it own the item and are simply letting you
				use it? Personally I think if you buy an item, digital or not,
				the consumer owns it. I won't go down that rabbit hole in this
				post so I'll keep to the topic of battle passes. The
				monetisation model of battle passes shows that you do not own
				the pass. You can not view a previous passes tiers when a new
				one is out. This would be like a company releasing an expansion
				pass that you can play for three months and then when they
				release a new expansion, regardless if you paid for the last
				one or not, you can no longer play what you paid for and to me
				that just doesn't make sense.</p>

				<p>The worst part about this is that every single battle pass
				in games does this and people seem completely fine with it. So
				we see more and more companies adding battle passes to their
				games and players buying them up without a second thought.
				This has caused a huge surge in these passes becoming a standard
				for games to include and thus brought about a model that is
				incredibly popular and blatantly anti consumer.</p>

				<h3>The Deadline Is Approaching</h3>
				<p>Another standard that you see with battle passes is the
				seasonal content model. At first like the battle pass model
				it seems really good. After a set amount of time the game will
				receive more content put into it which, in theory, should mean
				the game will continually receive patches and support over its
				lifetime. The only issue with these seasonal timers is that
				they're not hype countdowns for the next content drop. They're
				a deadline timer for both the players and the employees working
				at the company.</p>

				<p>Upon these seasonal timers reaching zero and the new content
				is put into the game you can kiss goodbye to the content of that
				season. If you've unlocked it all then that's great! You can still
				use that content in game if you choose to. But what if you
				didn't unlock everything? Well tough luck! You can't get any
				of those items any more. There's a new pass out and you should
				buy that instead. It doesn't matter if you bought the pass
				and partially completed it. The season is over and so is your
				chance to get the skins and emotes you wanted.</p>

				<p>This grinds my gears for a few reasons. Firstly is that by
				locking content you create a sense of panic in players. It doesn't
				matter if the player is enjoying your game or not. You're
				almost forcing them to play your game as much as possible if
				they want to get the digital items that are on the battle pass.
				I understand that an argument for this is that seasons last a
				long time. The only problem with that is in the big picture
				it doesn't matter how long the season is. When all games
				require you to a big chunk of time into them and almost all
				of them having this seasonal battle pass system implemented, it
				is not a case of you might lost out, it is a case that you will
				lose out.</p>

				<p>The second reason that this annoys me is that this system
				has no regard for the players free time. There are plenty of
				games coming out every year and people will want to play them.
				I understand that games as a whole are very competitive and
				standing out and keeping player retention is hard but these
				systems are very punishing. If a player has other hobbies that
				they like to balance with gaming, or they have other games they
				like to play, or simply something happens in their personal life
				that they have to dedicate their free time to instead of playing
				games, the timer doesn't care. If you didn't put enough time
				to get the items on the pass then you can't ever get them again.
				</p>

				<p>The last reason I don't like it is because it's a simple way
				to artificially inflate play time in a game. You can design a
				battle pass to take X amount of hours at minimum to complete.
				Regardless if the game is in a good state or not you can put out
				good looking items that are exclusive to the season and then
				create a nice little echo chamber. Oh the community is
				complaining about poor design decisions in the game? We don't
				have to put that high on the priority list, just look at the
				player count and the average time a player plays the game. As
				long as the content comes out on time and players keep buying
				the battle passes who cares if the quality of the product is
				good? Just make sure players are engaged and when the numbers
				start dipping then improve the game.</p>

				<p> An example of this
				happening is with Gears 5 (yes I know I go on about that game
				a LOT but it makes so many mistakes that you can learn from
				it's basically a gold mine). The game released with a battle
				pass system (which granted was free for all but that's not the
				point here) and they built the unlock system around that and
				the microtransaction store. So if you wanted nice looking skins
				then you either had to sink a lot of time into the game or cough
				up more money which unless you got it through game pass, already
				cost you £50-£60. People complained on YouTube and the Gears forums
				about the unlock system and how unrewarding it was but the
				Coalition didn't listen. They kept adding systems that artificially
				increased play time (like the totem system if anybody remembers
				how bad that was). As time went on the player base has dwindled
				and average monthly players on Steam peaks around 900 players.
				You can't see the average for Xbox and game pass as Microsoft
				doesn't make those numbers public but there are games from 2012
				with a higher active player base. Some of them are quadruple or
				quintuple the size. The Coalition have changed the unlock system
				and the store along with a load of other systems in the game
				but from what I can see not to much avail (might be a different
				story if I could see the stats but I can only go off of Steam
				player numbers here and my own experience with queue times and
				playing the game on launch). This is a great example of if you
				don't value the player then people will leave and stop playing
				your game.</p>

				<h3>How Battle Passes Can Be Better</h3>
				<p>Now on paper I like the idea of a battle pass. You support
				the developer by giving them a small fee and they allow you
				to unlock a lot of content by playing the game. Being able to
				simply unlock content is really good as with the rise for
				"pay to win" systems being popular, going back to unlocking
				items shows people that you simply didn't just take your wallet
				out and get buy an item. In this case you did put some time into
				the game albeit unlocking things with persistence rather than
				skill but that's a different topic. Also dropping new content
				each in game season and constantly updating and adding support
				to the game is a great thing. As long as you support your game
				well then people will continue to play and support it.</p>

				<p>Now I think that battle passes and seasonal content could
				be better by making some very simple changes. If you buy the
				pass then you own that pass. Regardless if the season ends or
				not, you should be allowed to unlock the items on the pass on
				your time, not when the game developers say. I also think that
				battle passes from previous seasons should be able to be purchased
				after the season has ended. I would say it's okay to allow a bit
				of a gap between purchasing a pass. For example releasing the pass
				for season 1 when season 4 has been release. But overall there
				is nothing bad about making a battle pass purchasable when the
				season is over. Players who missed the season get a chance to
				unlock items they missed out on and the games company gets more
				money from these users. It's a win win really.</p>

				<p>So that's what I think about battle passes. With a few simple
				changes it could go from an anti consumer practice to a pro
				consumer monetisation model with long lasting benefits to a game.
				Hopefully we can see a system like this implemented and see the
				standard for battle passes shift. But sadly for now we'll have
				to get through the current state of battle passes and seasonal
				content models and demand for change. We deserve good and
				rewarding systems in games and we should demand for them.</p>
