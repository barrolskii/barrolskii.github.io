		<h1>Book Organiser</h1>
		<h2>First feature update</h2>

		<time datetime="22-04-2020">APR. 22, 2020</time>
		<p>It's been a while since I last worked on the book organiser but a
		couple of weeks ago I updated the book organiser to have a couple of
		quality of life improvements.</p>

		<h3>GNU Readline</h3>
		<p>The last <a href="Bookorganiserpt2.html">blog post</a> that was
		covering the book organiser I showed a small list at the end which
		included some of the things I wanted to include in the next update,
		one of those things was autocompletion.
		There are a few menu options where you have to manually type input which
		could either be a book name or a tag that you want to search by. I found
		very quickly during testing that it turns into quite a chore to manually
		type what you want and not only that it provides a large margin for error.
		I also think autocomplete should be a standard with a lot of programs that
		accept user based string input. I've got the autocomplete working and to
		implement it I've used the GNU readline library. This library comes as a
		standard on Linux based operating systems and it's quite an easy library
		to use. Granted I did follow a
		<a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/tab-completion-in-gnu-readline">
		tutorial</a> to get an overview on how to use the library but to get the
		functionality working you only need two functions to implement yourself!</p>

		<h3>Better error handling</h3>
		<p>Another item on the list I had was to have some better error handling in
		the program and I think I've achieved this. I say I think because the
		program seems to be just fine when I've used it. I don't want to tick this
		off the list quite yet just because I haven't had runs where I've
		purposefully tried to break the program which is bad but hey, I can put that
		on the todo list and see what issues come up from it. So far though I'm
		pretty happy with how things work and with the implementation of the readline
		library there is less room for error when receiving user input. Granted
		that doesn't eliminate all room for error but far less is always much better.
		</p>

		<h3>Wrapper functions and general clean-up</h3>
		<p>Now here's something that I didn't get round to when working on this update
		and that's making generic wrapper functions. I've put on my list that the main
		focus are the menu functions but I'll apply where need be. This can easily be
		added to the clean-up job that I need to do because this codebase is really
		not the cleanest. It's not the worst work I've ever done and hell I am happy
		with my style of coding in a few places and would be quite happy to show other
		people. Which is quite rare for me, I'm very secretive of my project and I'm
		even more so of my code. I know that's a bad way to be as if you don't get
		your work out there and criticised then how can you improve? It is something
		I'm working on, I mean a big reason I started this blog was to get my stuff
		out there and be more comfortable talking about my projects. Anyway I'm
		getting off topic. Bottom line is the project does need some house keeping
		and some general improvements here and there. I think I still have some of
		the test wrapper functions that I tried out before so I think removing those
		would be a good start.</p>

		<h3>What's next on the todo list?</h3>
		<p>So like last time there won't be loads on the todo list here. I'm trying to
		keep it small just so sprints can be achieved relatively quickly.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Use and try to break the program to show unaccounted errors</li>
			<li>Tidy up messy bits of code and add some more comments if need be</li>
			<li>Implement function pointers where I can to refactor code</li>
		</ul>

		<p>It's only a little list but that will help the usability of the program and
		when I want to add more functionality down the line. I think this sums up
		everything for this update of the book organiser. I guess this marks version
		1.1.0 of the program and I'm yet to come up with a better name than book
		organiser...
