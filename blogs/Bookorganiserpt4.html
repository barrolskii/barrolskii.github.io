		<h1>Book Organiser</h1>
		<h2>Quality of life update</h2>

		<time datetime="09-08-2020">AUG. 09, 2020</time>
		<p>I've been slowly but surely working through my project to do list and
		I noticed I had a few things left to do for my book organiser. A few
		things on there were from the <a href="Bookorganiserpt3.html">last</a>
		blog post I made about this project but there were also a few I added
		when I thought of things that would improve the project. Plus this is a
		good time to add some quality of life improvements to the project as my
		book pile is getting rather small right now and I'm going to need some
		new things to read soon.</p>


		<h3>Test Run</h3>
		<p>I gave the program an initial test run to make sure things work nicely.
		I mean, there's no point in adding quality of life changes to something
		that you haven't even used right? I did run into one issue during the test
		run, a stack smashing error would pop up after a while and this was
		because I wasn't allocating enough memory for arrays on the stack. File
		names were exceeding the array size and causing this error to show up.
		But once I fixed that issue the program worked quite nicely.</p>

		<h3>Improvements</h3>
		<p>Although it did work nicely I did notice that there were a few things
		that could be improved to make the program a bit nicer for me to use. The
		one main issue I had with the program was the output would get cluttered
		and hard to read very quickly. This mostly occurred when adding tags to
		books and when querying the program to find specific books. This was an
		easy issue to deal with as I simply cleared the terminal after every
		book that is successfully tagged and I added an option to the menu to
		clear the output whenever I want.</p>

		<p>Another improvement I made was to the formatting of output when querying
		the program for books. When I did a search that yielded in a lot of
		results the output was very messy and the titles of each book weren't
		lining up properly. This was due to a bug in my code and the books
		are now align properly when printed. There is an issue with the alignment
		currently when printing non-ascii characters. I don't think this is due
		to the program but with the terminal I'm using and how it spaces non-ascii
		characters but its an issue nonetheless. I also added a nice little
		feature that scales the output based on terminal width. The program will
		print a table that's always 2/3 of the terminals width and scale the
		text accordingly which I'm really happy with.</p>

		<p>There's not much else to really talk about apart from a few clean ups
		here and there in the code base. There's no features I can think of at
		the moment to add to the program so this is a short update on it. I'm
		actually quite happy with the current state of the project, I think I'll
		do one more test run before I start using it properly. Only one thing
		still remains and that's I still haven't thought of a name for this
		program...</p>
