			<h1>Borderlands 3</h1>
			<h2>Changes <h2>

			<time datetime="20-02-2020">FEB. 20, 2020</time>
			<p>Recently I've been playing quite a bit of Borderlands 3 (by a bit I mean way more than
			I should be playing) and I've noticed quite a few annoyances that make me think "This needs
			to be fixed" or "Why isn't this a feature" and mostly "Why is this even in the game". So 
			instead of just writing a blog post just ranting about these things I'm going to include how
			I think these issues can be fixed/improved and what features I think could be added to the game
			to improve its overall quality of life.</p>

			<h3>Agoniser 9000 immune phase</h3>
			<p>I've just finished the normal campaign with my Vladof allegiance Moze and I want to get both a
			Dictator assault rifle and a Damned assault rife in all of their flavours. Both of these guns drop
			from Agoniser so I can kill two birds with one stone here and farm the same boss for them. I'm 
			having one issue with this boss currently and that is his immune phase when Pain says "We're just
			going for a quick commerical break". I cannot stand this phase when I'm trying to farm this boss as
			it extends the overall farm time for the boss. I've been farming this boss with my Fl4k on mayhem
			4 (because my Valdof Moze is not ready for mayhem 4 yet) and this is when I find the phase most
			annoying. The immunity is inconsistent and some runs I can burst through Agoniser's armour in one
			burst and other times my burst damage gets cut short and as my Torgue shotgun sticky projectiles are
			still exploding Pain will say his voice line and stop me from getting my quick kill. I understand 
			having that phase in the fight for the story because you won't be killing Agoniser that quickly on the
			first playthrough of a new character and that break in-between the fight is good to heal up and stock
			up on ammo. But I feel for the higher modes in mayhem that it's not needed and just artificially extends
			the bosses kill time. So my suggestion for improving this issue is just not having that phase when you're
			in mayhem mode</p>

			<h3>Cosmetic items in the global loot pool</h3>
			<p>Don't you love it when you've just killed a boss and see two big golden beams of light on the ground
			in the big pile of loot the boss has just dropped to find that both of the legendary items are cosmetics
			that you already have for each character? No? Neither do I. I actually despise the fact that even if you've
			unlocked the cosmetic items that they're not removed from the loot pool for you to earn them again. To add
			insult to injury, these items are worth $1 so you can't even make any money from them in game. So the fix
			most people are asking for this is to simply remove them from the loot pool when you've unlocked them but I
			have a different idea. There is a challenge system in Borderlands 3, similar to the previous games but in this
			one it doesn't award you xp or badass rank, it gives you eridium for completing challenges. I think that all
			cosmetic items should be removed from the global loot pool so no enemy can drop them and instead tie them
			to challenges. I think this would give players more incentive to complete these challenges and it would 
			offer a nice reward for taking the time out and doing them. Why stop at cosmetics? why not award legendary
			and unique weapons for completing challenges (Don't make them only available through these challenges though.
			We still need a way to farm them). If you've already unlocked a character skin, echo skin or character head
			that is tied to a challenge then simply replace the reward with a weapon. I think this would be a much better
			system as there a manufacturer skins in the game that aren't tied to the manufacturer specific challenges.
			Speaking of weapon manufacturers...</p>

			<h3>Manufacturer kill tracker</h3>
			<p>As you know there is a system in the game where if you get 100 kills with a specific manufacturer they 
			will mail you a weapon in game. I love this system but I find myself wishing there was a way to track what
			number of kills I'm on before my next mail drop, so I think that having a kill tracker would be a nice
			quality of life improvement. </p>

			<h3>Fade away animation blend with sliding</h3>
			<p>I've noticed when using Fl4k's fade away ability I can use it when sprinting and switching weapons which
			is really nice as I don't have to do one action at a time and it keeps combat flow nice and smooth. The 
			only issue with it is I can't use fade away when sliding. It's not a huge issue but it would be nice to see
			this added as it seems like a good quality of life addition for Fl4k and it would stop the actions of using 
			fade away and then sliding feel clunky to do during combat.</p>

			<h3>Cryo effects on the player</h3>
			<p>Cryo is the worst element. Not to use against enemies but to have it used against you. It annoys me so much
			when I'm fighting enemies with cryo weapons as they have a 100% chance to apply cryo to you. Did you get hit
			by a stray projectile when trying to run for cover? Well tough you're now slowed and will probably die in an
			awkward position. Trying to get a speedboost from your snowdrift but got hit just as you started the slide?
			Well now you're in a crouched position hardly able to move making you a much easier target to hit and down.
			The slowing effects against the player are so harsh and I honstly don't get why because the AI gets no benefit
			from cryo being this way. This isn't balanced for PvE and if a PvP game has it this way there would be an 
			uproar about how overpowered it is. I think cryo should just slow you down by about %15-%20 of normal speed and
			still allow you to do thing like sprint and slide just... at a slower speed. It's a punishing element to go up
			against with no item to make you immune to it (even though there's a shield that makes you immune to radiation).
			Gearbox please, do something about the effects of cryo to the player because it's so frustrating.</p>

			<h3>Militant shields</h3>
			<p>While we're on the topic of annoying game mechanics, militant shields. Specifically both normal militants
			and anointed ones. Why are their shields immune to damage? No really why? You can stagger a militant if you
			melee their shield but the window of opportunity to do damage to them, I find, is way too small. Nomads in
			Borderlands 2 were frustrating to fight as their shields were completely immune to damage and I would've
			thought that Gearbox would learn that, that's not a fun thing to fight. Apparently not. I don't know if 
			other people find them as annoying to fight as I do. I mean I don't find them difficult to fight I just
			find that blocking 100% of my damage with no way to destroy the shield it just not good design. The
			new riot loaders in the Handsome Jackpot DLC have shields you can destroy so why not have this for the
			militants? So that's what I want, shields that aren't immune to damage and that can be destroyed.</p>

			<h3>Bring back seraph items!</h3>
			<p>Although they weren't the best items in Borderlands 2 I did find they were fun to try and get. In case 
			you haven't played Borderlands 2, seraph items were items that only raid bosses could drop or that you could
			only buy from the seraph vendor with seraph crystals (which were dropped by the raid boss). I think this 
			rarity should make a comeback in Borderlands 3, they don't have to be better than legendary weapons, if 
			anything, how they should be treated is the same as legendaries. The only difference being is the rarity colour
			to show that it is a weapon that has been added to the game via a raid boss or as they're calling them now, 
			takedowns.</p>

			<h3>Stop timed events</h3>
			<p>I'm not saying stop adding content to the game that is based on events like Christmas, Halloween, 
			Valentines ect. I don't want the content to only be available during the week of that event. I think
			having gear that can only be unlocked when the event is active and that if you don't play the game 
			during that event week you are locked out of it until next year is really unfair and dumb. I do
			understand that it's to add a sense of urgency and to get players to come back to the game but so far 
			I find that the events have been executed so poorly that this model is not going to help with the 
			longevity of the game or the replayability. I was watching stream highlights from 
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNoyrAASAelSBLX_ZWIq0uA">oboeshoestwos</a> and one of the 
			stream commenters said can you imagine in Boderlands 2 if the head hunter DLCs were time limited? I 
			loved concept of a head hunter DLC, they're very small bits of content priced at about £3-£4 and they
			add a new map, a new mission, a new boss and some new customisation options for the character classes.
			They weren't all the best pieces of content added to the game but some of them like the Mercenary day 
			and the Son of Crawmerax were really fun. The Mercenay day head hunter DLC is really good for the loot 
			chests that you get after beating the DLCs boss Mr Tinder Snowflake. I know I've put more farming time
			into that DLC than I can count and if that DLC was time limited it would've ruined the experience. These
			DLCs have the potential to shake the games meta up and they could be used to address issues in the game.
			Oh is a gun a nightmare to farm because you have to get to the end of a circle of slaughter? Add the
			drops to a boss in a head hunter DLC and make sure that the boss isn't a nightmare to farm. There we go
			you've just added content and fixed an issue in one go. Now I don't beleive that is the proper way to deal
			with bad drop locations and badly designed bosses but it's a quick fix to have which players can go to as 
			you address the issue. So for these events, I think they should follow the Borderlands 2 head hunter pack 
			formula except don't just have them as throw away pieces of content. As the event comes around the year after, 
			expand on the content. Add a new halloween map, add more halloween based missions and gear (This isn't limited
			to the halloween event but you get what I mean). Content packs like that have a lot of potential for being so 
			small. You just have to utilise that potential right.</p>

			<h3>Make Torgue weapons fully automatic again!</h3>
			<p>There are too many semi automatic weapons in the game in my opinion. I get why Jakobs weapons are (almost) 
			always semi automatic but I don't see why almost all torgue weapons are semi automatic (I say almost all as 
			there are a few legendaries that are fully automatic or burst fire). They were fully automatic in Borderlands 
			2 and I want to see this return. The only reason why I don't use Torgue pistols or assault rifles is because the 
			non-unique or legendary Torgue weapons are always semi automatic and I find it makes them not fun to use. Bring 
			back the Torgue I enjoyed to use. You changed the projectile speed from being unacceptably slow in Borderlands 
			2 to being perfect in Borderlands 3, so just let me have my fully automatic Torgue weapons. I mean they have an 
			exhaust on them, that must mean the gun has an engine in it, that must power the gun for a fully automatic mode 
			surely?</p>

			<h3>Save my weapon state</h3>
			<p>This is a really small quality of life change but weapons that can switch modes, that being Torgue's impact to
			sticky mode, Maliwans elemental swapping or Dahls alternate fire mode doesn't persist when you quit the game and 
			then load back in. Some guns, like Torgue shotguns I always keep in sticky mode and I have Dahl weapons that I 
			always swap to their alternate burst fire or fully automatic mode. But if I load back into the game it swaps these 
			weapons back to their default state. So quite simply I would like to have whatever mode I was last on with the 
			weapon saved so upon loading into the game, it remembers how I left my weapon. Small feature but I think that would 
			go a long way.</p>

			<h3>Lock more weapons to mayhem difficulties</h3>
			<p>So the final thing I would like to see changed is enemies with multiple dedicated drops improved. There has 
			been a patch addressing the legendary problem but it simply was not enough and it needs more work. Bosses have 
			multiple weapons that can only drop from them but with how diluted the loot pool is, as world drop legendaries 
			are more common that dedicated drops it makes it difficult to farm for the weapons you want. I work full time 
			at the moment and I simply don't have the time to put 6-7 hours into farming for weapons. I've tried farming 
			Billy the anointed for a Warlord and I've had more Lead Sprinklers and Gatlin' gun drops from him than the 
			Warlord. Since the addition of mayhem 4 certain bosses drop guns that are only available on that difficulty, so 
			what I would like to see is bosses and unique enemies that have multiple dedicated drops, have specific weapons 
			locked to certain mayhem difficulties. Do you want a Dictator Assault rifle from Agoniser 9000? Farm him on 
			mayhem 3. Want a Warlord from Billy the anointed like I do? Farm him on mayhem 2. I think this will make farming 
			specific dedicated drops much easier and a lot more fun as you won't have to sift through so many junk weapons 
			when you're farming for one piece of gear. Now all Gearbox has to do is address the issue with how low the drop 
			rates are for dedicated weapons...</p>

			<h3>That's it, for now...</h3>
			<p>So that's all I have to say about Borderlands 3 right now. This is not going to be a one off so there will be
			another over opinionated post about how I think this game should be fixed. But as of now this is the stuff I'd 
			like to see addressed. Don't get me wrong I love this game but there are so many things in the game that need 
			fixing. I want to be rewarded for putting time into the game and not punished by RNG for doing the things that 
			I'm supposed to be doing. Oh well, let's just see which direction the next hotfixed take us...</p>
