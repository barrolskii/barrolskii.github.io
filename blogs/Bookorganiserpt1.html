			<h1>Book Organiser</h1>
			<h2>Re-worked and remastered</h2>

			<time datetime="15-02-2020">FEB. 15, 2020</time>
			<p>As of today I "finished" a rework of a previous project of mine, my book organiser.
			Quite simply this project is a small program written in C that I use to categorise my
			digital library of books. Very simple premise but after the first version of it I wasn't
			very happy with how the categorisation system worked in it. I set up a system that
			organised books into separate directories and because of how varied my digital book
			library is, there were some cases where there would be directories only containing a single
			book and trawling through them manually to find a book was not fun (I did put a search
			feature into it but it was kinda hacky with a lot of string concatenation and there were
			definitely better ways for searching for a specific book). So in this new re-worked
			version I have used a nicer way of tagging and sorting the books. I've used a tagging
			system that a friend of mine has made called <a href="https://gitlab.com/finnoleary/koios">
			koios.</a></p>

			<h3>So what's new?</h3>
			<p>I won't go into detail about how koios works itself, (there is a brief description about how
			the system works on the <a href="https://gitlab.com/finnoleary/koios">GitLab</a> page) but I'll
			explain what I've done differently as to the old version. This time around there is no moving
			lots and lots of files around into different directories, instead all books within a given
			directory will be moved to a subfolder called books. Now this does seem kind of pointless to
			have a program to move my books into a different directory, I mean you can do that manually
			a lot quicker than writing the program, but the tagging magic is done before they are moved
			into this new directory. Moving them into a sub-directory is just an easy way to search for
			specific books at a later date.</p>

			<h3>Tagging</h3>
			<p>So just before the books are moved into the books directory by the program, the user (right
			now the user is me) is prompted twice to simply add two tags to a book. These tags are a single
			class and a single division from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification">
			Dewey Decimal System.</a> This first set of tags keeps it simple to have generic classifications
			for all of my books that I have now and for books I will buy in the future.</p>

			<h3>Why move the files at all?</h3>
			<p>The reason I move my book files into a new directory is really simple, the parent directory
			that is used to store the books sub-directory is scanned for new files everytime the program is
			run. So whenever I buy new books all I have to do is move them into the parent directory and
			then just run the program and it'll detect that there are new files within the directory, then
			prompting me to categorise them and then moving them with the other books to keep the parent
			directory clean.</p>

			<h3>So is that it?</h3>
			<p>For a basic overview of how the program works, yeah. It's not complicated but it was never
			meant to be. It's just a simple tool I'm going to use to make keeping track and orgainising my
			books that bit easier (I have a stupid amount of books already. I'll totally read them all I
			swear!). Now I'll be honest, this new version does have a few things at the end that have been
			thrown together, that being a little bit hacky and there are a few things programmed inelegantly.
			Not to mention there are loads of features missing that I want to add but having this bare bones
			version be what I'm calling the official 1.0.0 version is intentional. I want to keep adding
			features and making things better for this project over small iterations. One might call it an
			<b>agile</b> process. Having a simple project like this to add to could really help me break bad
			habits that I'm falling into with personal projects. I follow an agile development method in work
			and I don't get why I don't bring the good methodologies of of this work style back home to my projects.
			I don't exactly follow a heavyweight methodology when I'm working on my projects but using things like
			a scrum board or a kanban board really do help with prioritising work and keeping projects on track.</p>

			<h3>So, what's the plan?</h3>
			<p>The plan I have currently is for version 1.1.0 and I'm going to have a sprint for this version.
			In this next version I want to add a few new features for adding tags easily and cleaning up some
			of the code in source files. I know for a fact with the menu option functions they share a hell of
			a lot of the same code and instead of duplicating them I should just create a function delegate to
			minimise duplicate code. I think the function that takes a delegate should pass a struct with
			into the functions it's calling and from there they'll deal with the unique logic but I'll figure
			that out as I go. Also I want to clean up some of the menu displays, they could do with a bit of
			polish as not much of the output is cleaned up from previous queries. But first I think I should
			think of a better name for the program. Book organiser is just so bland...</p>
