				<h1>Rarity Systems</h1>
				<h2>An overused game mechanic</h2>

				<time datetime="22-12-2020">DEC. 22, 2020</time>
				<p>If you've played any shooter, action RPG, or free to play game
				within the last decade you will have seen a colour system in the
				game denoting how rare an item is. Usually games follow the
				white, green, blue, purple, orange system but there are a few
				here and there that have different colours like in CS:GO. For
				the most part though I think that this colour rarity loot is
				a redundant feature in most games and should never have been
				included in the first place.</p>

				<h3>The Case For Colour Rarity</h3>
				<p>Now I don't think that the system should be removed from
				gaming entirely. In fact I'm well aware that there are a lot of
				cases where the system makes sense. Take a game like Borderlands
				for example which is where I was first introduced to the system.
				The game has a tiered weapon system where the tier of a weapon
				directly influences its stats and what individual components
				that the gun can be made out of. In my opinion a colour system
				like this makes sense as you can quickly come to terms with
				what you can expect for a weapon and what to look out for when
				you're playing the game.</p>

				<p>Another game that I think utilises the colour rarity system
				well is Fortnite. If you're not familiar with the guns in
				Fortnite they have weapons that aren't randomly generated like
				in Borderlands but instead have set guns. These guns will then
				have direct upgrades that will have at minimum better damage
				and better accuracy. In some cases when guns reach a high
				enough rarity they will have an entirely new model. This is
				another area where I think the colour rarity system makes sense
				as when you're in game you can quickly identify upgrades of
				weapons. This is great for a multiplayer game like Fortnite as
				quick decision making is key. Also it has the same benefit as
				Borderlands where you can quickly get familiar with how a
				weapon of a certain tier performs. In the case of Fortnite you
				can learn this far quicker than Borderlands as Fortnite has
				far fewer guns to choose from and the guns don't have randomly
				spawning parts. Every white pistol is going to act the same no
				matter what.</p>

				<h3>The Case Against Colour Rarity</h3>
				<p>So this first point I feel like a lot of people will disagree
				with me but I really feel strongly about this. Colour rarity
				should not be used for weapon or character skins. There are loads
				of games that do this now. CS:GO is the main offender here as
				they've had a system like that for years. Gears of War 4 and
				Gears 5 have a weapon skin and character rarity colour system.
				Not to mention Valorant, Fortnite, and a plethora of free to play
				games have these attached to their microtransactions. Now the
				main reason to why I think rarity systems should not be attached
				to skins is simply because whether or not a skin is seen as good
				or bad is subjective. It's up to the player to decide if they
				like a skin or not, not your rarity system.</p>

				<p>Granted there are plenty of cases where the vast majority of
				players will say that they like a particular weapon skin and
				as a community said weapon skin or character skin will be sought
				after. But for the most part I feel systems like that are used
				to artificially inflate the price of a product so the company
				selling these microtransaction skins can make more money. Take
				Valorant for example. That game releases weapon skin sets on
				rotation. One set that was on rotation was a space themed
				weapon set that was very poorly and lazily made. There was no
				layering or animations included in the weapon skin set. It was
				simply a texture wrapped around an entire weapon. For this set
				which only included 4 weapon skins and a knife skin was sold for
				roughly £70. The justification for this high price was that
				they're all blue rarity weapon skins so they cost more and as
				a bundle you're getting a slight discount than if you were to
				buy them individually.</p>

				<p>Let's use Fortnite as the next example. Fortnite sells
				character skins that usually max out at 2000 of their in game
				currency. A single highest rarity character skin that you can
				not earn, you have no choice but to buy it will cost you roughly
				£16-£20. Do all of these skins look good? No of course they don't
				and like I said before what looks good and bad is subject to the
				users preference. Now I know that an argument to this is if you
				don't like the skins then don't buy them or if you don't like the
				practice don't support it. But when a game and its community put
				a big emphasis on these skins that you can't earn and have to
				pay for, I feel is a malicious practice that shouldn't be
				allowed to continue. Especially with artificially inflating the
				value of a product by putting a different colour rarity on it.</p>

				<p>The other case I have against rarity systems in games is when
				they are included into the gameplay when it serves no purpose
				or it is simply included for the sake of it. My main offenders
				here are Far Cry and Assassins Creed. I've played Assassins
				Creed for a long time, the old games have set weapons that you
				can unlock as you get further into the game and will offer slight
				differences. In Assassins Creed 2 I remember some weapons would
				have a higher attack speed, some would have better blocking,
				and the end game weapons would basically be great at both. Far
				Cry 3 was my favourite Far Cry game (like most people) and that
				game had a nice arsenal of weapons that all performed different
				roles pretty well. I remember mostly using the bow and the AK47
				but that was only because those were my favourites to use.</p>

				<p>There was no inclusion of rarity systems back then. Granted
				the system wasn't a standard back then as it was today but you
				didn't need it. You had the weapons stats available and if you
				wanted to see a gun in Far Cry did more damage or a sword in
				Assassins Creed then you would look at the damage and compare it
				to the weapon you were currently using. It was that simple. If
				you wanted to see if you liked using a weapon then you would
				go out and use it. You didn't need a colour system to declare to
				you that the AK is better than your pistol because of a special
				colour that came with it. Or that the starter sword is worse than
				a sword a shop is selling because the starter sword is white
				rarity and the shops sword is green. You knew because you used it
				and you looked at the stats. Adding a colour rarity system here
				is an empty game mechanic that adds nothing to the players
				experience.</p>

				<p>I've noticed now with the new Far Cry and Assassins Creed
				titles that they've added health bars and damage numbers to
				enemies along with these loot rarity systems. These aren't the
				only games to do this but it seems that adding these colour
				systems turns franchises into Diablo/Borderlands spins offs in
				different genres.</p>

				<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
				<p>I'm aware that this does sound like me ranting about a system
				for the sake of it or that I'm ranting just because I don't like
				it but that's not the case and that's not the point I want you
				to take away from reading this. I guess the tldr of this is I
				think the colour rarity system is overused and not needed in
				most games today. Like I said at the start it does have a useful
				purpose and can be a great mechanic in games but from how
				overused it is right now most games just have it for the sake
				of having it or like I said to artificially inflate the price
				of microtransactions. I think that the rarity colour system
				should be in a game when it makes sense, when it is actually
				respected and weapons and loot in a game are accurately
				represented with the correct rarity or the colour of rarity
				quickly shows a player that they have an upgrade right in front
				of them. You don't always need to colour code items to show that
				they are rare or good. Simply showing the stats and having
				items that you can only unlock with a lot of in game earnable
				currency shows to a user that it's good. Not an orange highlight.
