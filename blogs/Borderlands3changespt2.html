<h1>Borderlands 3</h1>
		<h2>Some more changes I'd like to see</h2>

		<time datetime="03-08-2020">AUG. 03, 2020</time>
		<p>I've taken a break from playing Borderlands 3 and in recent weeks I've
		picked the game back up. The last time I played I wasn't happy with the
		current state of the game and I thought there's no point in playing it
		if it's just going to cause me frustration. I think the last time I
		played was during the cartel event. I found that event to be fun but I
		found the overall experience to be lacklustre and a lot of the problems
		that the game had either at launch or a few patches after launch to still
		persist. So I thought now is probably a good time to give my options on
		the current state of the game and how I think certain aspects could be
		improved.</p>

		<h3>Mayhem mode</h3>
		<p>Mayhem mode has been overhauled in an update called Mayhem 2.0. 1.0
		wasn't a great experience and the addition of mayhem 4 killed a lot of
		character builds making them unplayable late game and destroyed end
		game weapon balancing, causing Gearbox to buff weapons to be stupidly
		powerful. Mayhem 2.0 was meant to fix these problems, allowing for more
		end game build diversity, different modifiers that make the game more
		interesting, and even more choice in which weapons players want to use
		at end game. In my opinion they have not achieved this.</p>

		<p>I'll start with one thing they did decently well and that was the
		mêlée scaling and the action skill damage scaling. Mêlée builds and
		using you action skill is actually viable in end game now. I'm very
		happy to hear about and see builds of this in game as this is a step in
		the right direction for end game build diversity. Letting players play
		the way they want is always a good thing. What they haven't done is the
		same for weapons. When mayhem 2.0 first came out a big complaint was
		that it was basically the same end game as Borderlands 2 where only a
		few specific weapons were viable and every build had to have them. They
		made some changes in the next few patches which allowed for a few more
		weapons to be viable at mayhem level 10 (the highest difficulty) but I
		found that unless you were using top tier weapons then you won't be able
		to play at the highest difficulty</p>

		<p>One of my favourite builds to play in the game is an assault rifle
		Moze build, where you utilise bottomless mags, no iron bear, and use
		different assault rifles of the same manufacturer (all with different
		elements) to mow through hordes of enemies. I have two guns I like to use
		in particular, the Kaos, and the Warlord. I managed to pick up a mayhem
		10 version of both of those weapons and found that they just didn't have
		the stopping power to be viable at that difficulty. I've tried using other
		weapons as well like the Maggie, Lyuda, the 9 vold, but hardly any of them
		pack a punch when fighting enemies at end game. I now use the Flipper
		and Light show (like almost everyone in the player base) because they're
		the easiest guns to get and they do insane amounts of damage. I'm so
		jaded when it comes to following the meta weapons in Borderlands because
		I did it for 7 years in Borderlands 2. And to be quite honest if I'm
		going to be doing the same thing as I did in that game I might as well
		go back and play that game because it has far better replay value than
		3 and you can mod the game.</p>

		<h3>Mayhem modifiers</h3>
		<p>With the addition of mayhem 2.0 came the addition of new modifiers.
		You have no choice but to play with these at end game and if you want
		the mayhem exclusive drops but don't want the hassle of these modifiers
		you're fresh out of luck. Hearing the complains of the first set of
		modifiers, this time Gearbox allows you to randomly role modifiers for
		your mayhem experience. Not choose what modifiers you want but randomly
		role them and hope you get the modifiers you want. I think that is such
		a stupid system to implement and is a massive waste of players time.
		No matter what people are going to want to play with the modifiers that
		benefits them the most so if you allowed players to pick and choose
		individual modifiers they'll just choose the optimal ones. Allowing for
		random roles just forces players to endure through modifiers that they
		don't like and if they don't want to endure they'll have to waste time
		rolling modifiers hoping they get the one's that they want.</p>

		<p>I find the selection of modifiers available to be very poor and don't
		make the game a more enjoyable experience. Big head mode is straight from
		the 90s and I think that modifier should stay there. Okay it makes
		critical shots easier to hit but it just doesn't feel like it should be
		in the game. Big head mode is funny when you are a kid for a couple of
		seconds but then the joke stops being funny. Buddy system is another
		poor choice in modifiers but it's also one of the best to get. Some
		enemies will spawn with a robot that makes them invulnerable (great
		balance right?) and the only way to stop them from being invulnerable
		is to kill the buddy system. Only problem is the buddy system doesn't
		have collision enabled and so can clip through the geometry. Meaning
		you have to wait there like a lemon for the robot to fly out of the
		geometry to be hit. Another dumb modifier is the -75% critical hit
		damage modifier. This completely kills Fl4k's critical hit builds and
		means if you can kill enemies with body shots don't even bother. It makes
		enemies even spongier than they already are and that is a poor decision
		to make when their health values have been increased by 10,000%! There
		are plenty more modifiers I don't like and think don't add anything to
		the game but those are the ones that come to me off the top of my head.</p>

		<p>Well there's no point in complaining about these things if I don't
		offer some sort of suggestion to improve. Personally I think they should
		get rid of the modifiers altogether. Unless they want to change it to where
		they are completely optional and they have added benefits (increased
		quality of loot drops, bosses have a higher chance to drop their
		dedicated loot) then I really don't see the point in having them in the
		game. I also believe that the health scaling should go. I think instead
		of buffing health values by 10,000%, you should base the difficulty
		off of players accuracy and element matching abilities. What I mean by this
		is, for mayhem 1-5, damage to enemies bodies should be lowered but critical
		hits should either remain the same or offer slightly increased damage. The
		damage reduction in non-critical hits would cap out at mayhem 5 but the skill
		then would be based off of players accuracy. Then for mayhem levels 6-10
		you will do less damage for not matching elements. So if you try and kill
		an enemy with body shots with a shock weapon against flesh, then you'll have
		a really tough time. But if you hit your crits and use a fire weapon against
		the flesh target then you'll be rewarded with a quick kill. This means you
		only have to balance the damage reduction modifiers so that they feel fair
		and means you don't have to completely overhaul the current weapon balance
		system. If you want to make sure players are also farming for gear with
		mayhem levels attached to them then add another damage resistance modifier
		that reduces damage based on the mayhem level of the gun.</p>

		<h3>DLC quality</h3>
		<p>So far Gearbox has released three full DLC packs for the game and
		honestly I think so far they have all been great. I've enjoyed each one
		so far and I was pleasantly surprised with the newest bounty of blood
		DLC. The free events on the other hand I find have not been up to par. The
		cartel event was fun but there is still the massive issue of them being
		timed events. I will keep complaining about it until they do it but, they
		need to make them permanent additions to the game and when the events
		come back around just add more content to them! I'll happily pay for them
		just like the head hunter packs in Borderlands 2 but right now, locking
		content away in a PvE game to seasons I find insulting. Gearbox really
		need to sort themselves out there.</p>

		<p>I think overall the game is in a better place than when I last played
		it but I still don't think it's in the state it should be. There are still
		a weapons that Gearbox haven't put into the loot pool since launch,
		there's still not much reason to keep playing at end game, and overall
		re-playability is nowhere near to where Borderlands 2 is. I'm very
		hopeful that the game will get there and these are just bumps in the road
		to greatness. I complain about the problems of this game because I love
		the Borderlands series and I want it to be a great experience. But overall
		Gearbox really need to figure out which direction they want to take this
		game. Borderlands 2 was just about having fun, Randy Pitchford himself
		said they didn't include some mechanics in 2 from Borderlands 1 because
		they weren't fun. Having the main priority as fun for Borderlands 2 worked
		for them. I think they need to do this for Borderlands 3 otherwise it
		won't last nearly as long a 2 did.</p>
